%% ADD SOMEH+THING HERE ABOUT USING ELECTRON GAS AS A TEST BED TO DEVELOP METHODS BUT NOW ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON GPs AND APPLY IT TO 


We have explored and developed the SRE method by applying it in various ways to the infinite electron gas.  The electron gas, with its shorter computational times and more straightforward interactions, makes it an excellent test bed to develop methods that can be applied to other infinite matter systems. This chapter studies one of these more complicated systems: infinite nuclear matter.  Therefore, we will be using SRE methods perfected on the electron gas. For this chapter, all SRE algorithms use Gaussian processes with a modified rational quadratic kernel that was developed in the last section of the previous chapter.  We will start our studies in this chapter with pure neutron matter with both toy and realistic nuclear interactions and then move on to symmetric nuclear matter with realistic interactions before concluding with a brief study of the symmetry energy of infinite nuclear matter.
