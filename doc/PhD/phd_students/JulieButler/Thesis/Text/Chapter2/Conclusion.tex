%% Summary of what has been covered
In this chapter, we have developed second quantization and diagrammatic methods, two frameworks that will allow us to represent and solve problems in many-body physics more efficiently. However, many problems of interest are still too large and complicated to be solved with the full Schr\"{o}dinger's equation approach, even with the advancements made in this chapter. Therefore, in addition to these two frameworks, we need to develop a set of many-body methods, which will provide approximate solutions to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, but which will be able to describe much larger systems of interest. In the next chapter, three of these many-body methods will be developed--Hartree-Fock theory, many-body perturbation theory, and coupled cluster theory--with coupled cluster theory being particularly interesting to the remainder of this thesis.
