In this chapter, we have explored the two systems of interest in this thesis: homogeneous electron gas and infinite nuclear matter.  We have also developed a single-particle basis for these calculations which provides a convenient method for truncating the number of particles in the system and the number of single-particle states, which is required due to computational limitations.  We have also investigated two nuclear interaction models and seen some errors that can occur when trying to model an infinite system in a finite computational space.  

Up until this point, this thesis has focused on the physical framework necessary for understanding this work.  We first developed a many-body framework to define our many-body systems.  We then developed three many-body methods which can be used to find the energies of our systems, and finally, we explored the two systems of interest.  The following two chapters will develop the needed computational framework: machine learning and the basics of the SRE method.
