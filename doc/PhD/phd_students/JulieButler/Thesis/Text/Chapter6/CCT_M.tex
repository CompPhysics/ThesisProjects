For removing the basis incompleteness errors from calculations using the approximative triples methods, we will use the same method developed for removing the basis incompleteness errors from CCD calculations.  Even though the MPBT2 correlation energies are still at a comparatively lower level of approximation than the CCDT approximations, the SRE methods will still extrapolate well because both MBPT2 and CCDT converge as the value of M increases, and both MBPT2 and CCDT converge at roughly the same rate.  So, fortunately, CCD and CCDT correlation energies can be predicted with the same methods.

However, we will not perform extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit for the approximative triples calculations because we will use system sizes that already reduce the finite size effects.  This will be explained in greater detail in Chapter 8.
