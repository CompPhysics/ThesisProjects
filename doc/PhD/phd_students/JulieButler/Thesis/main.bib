abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of modern research and application. The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to physicists. The review begins by covering fundamental concepts in ML and modern statistics such as the bias–variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, generalization, and gradient descent before moving on to more advanced topics in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Topics covered in the review include ensemble models, deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization, energy-based models (including MaxEnt models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many natural connections between ML and statistical physics. A notable aspect of the review is the use of Python Jupyter notebooks to introduce modern ML/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton–proton collisions). We conclude with an extended outlook discussing possible uses of machine learning for furthering our understanding of the physical world as well as open problems in ML where physicists may be able to contribute.}

abstractNote = {Heavy atomic nuclei have an excess of neutrons over protons, which leads to the formation of a neutron skin whose thickness is sensitive to details of the nuclear force. This links atomic nuclei to properties of neutron stars, thereby relating objects that differ in size by orders of magnitude. The nucleus 208Pb is of particular interest because it exhibits a simple structure and is experimentally accessible. However, computing such a heavy nucleus has been out of reach for ab initio theory. By combining advances in quantum many-body methods, statistical tools and emulator technology, we make quantitative predictions for the properties of 208Pb starting from nuclear forces that are consistent with symmetries of low-energy quantum chromodynamics. We explore 109 different nuclear force parameterizations via history matching, confront them with data in select light nuclei and arrive at an importance-weighted ensemble of interactions. We accurately reproduce bulk properties of 208Pb and determine the neutron skin thickness, which is smaller and more precise than a recent extraction from parity-violating electron scattering but in agreement with other experimental probes. This work demonstrates how realistic two- and three-nucleon forces act in a heavy nucleus and allows us to make quantitative predictions across the nuclear landscape.},

One goal of such studies is to determine how well the existing data, and only the data, determines the mapping from the proton and neutron numbers to the mass of the nuclear ground state. Another is to provide reliable predictive models that can be used to forecast mass values away from the valley of stability. Our study focuses mainly on the former goal and achieves substantial improvement over previous neural-network models of the mass table by using improved schemes for coding and training. The results suggest that with further development this approach may provide a valuable complement to conventional global models.}

In this paper, ANN have been employed on experimental nuclear charge radii. Statistical modeling of nuclear charge radii using ANN are seen to be successful. Based on the outputs of ANN we have estimated a new simple mass-dependent nuclear charge radii formula. Also, the charge radii, binding energies and two-neutron separation energies of Sn isotopes have been calculated by implementation of a new estimated formula in Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov calculations. The results of the study show that the new estimated formula is useful for describing nuclear charge radii.}

abstract = {Elucidating the behavior of quantum interacting systems of many particles remains one of the biggest challenges in physics. Traditional numerical methods often work well, but some of the most interesting problems leave them stumped. Carleo and Troyer harnessed the power of machine learning to develop a variational approach to the quantum many-body problem (see the Perspective by Hush). The method performed at least as well as state-of-the-art approaches, setting a benchmark for a prototypical two-dimensional problem. With further development, it may well prove a valuable piece in the quantum toolbox. Science, this issue p. 602; see also p. 580 A machine-learning approach sets a computational benchmark for a prototypical two-dimensional problem. The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates from the difficulty of describing the nontrivial correlations encoded in the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with a variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme we demonstrate is capable of both finding the ground state and describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. Our approach achieves high accuracy in describing prototypical interacting spins models in one and two dimensions.}}

abstract = {The structure of neutron stars is considered from theoretical and observational perspectives. We demonstrate an important aspect of neutron star structure: the neutron star radius is primarily determined by the behavior of the pressure of matter in the vicinity of nuclear matter equilibrium density. In the event that extreme softening does not occur at these densities, the radius is virtually independent of the mass and is determined by the magnitude of the pressure. For equations of state with extreme softening or those that are self-bound, the radius is more sensitive to the mass. Our results show that in the absence of extreme softening, a measurement of the radius of a neutron star more accurate than about 1 km will usefully constrain the equation of state. We also show that the pressure near nuclear matter density is primarily a function of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, while the nuclear incompressibility and skewness parameters play secondary roles. In addition, we show that the moment of inertia and the binding energy of neutron stars, for a large class of equations of state, are nearly universal functions of the star's compactness. These features can be understood by considering two analytic, yet realistic, solutions of Einstein's equations, by, respectively, Buchdahl and Tolman. We deduce useful approximations for the fraction of the moment of inertia residing in the crust, which is a function of the stellar compactness and, in addition, the pressure at the core-crust interface.}

We consider observations made not only with photons, ranging from radio waves to X-rays, but also those involving neutrinos and gravity waves. We detail how precision determinations of structural properties would lead to significant restrictions on the poorly understood equation of state near and beyond the equilibrium density of nuclear matter. To begin, a theoretical analysis of neutron star structure, including general relativistic limits to mass, compactness, and spin rates is made. A review is the made of recent observations such as pulsar timing (which leads to mass, spin period, glitch and moment of inertia estimates), optical and X-ray observations of cooling neutron stars (which lead to estimates of core temperatures and ages and inferences about the internal composition), and X-ray observations of accreting and bursting sources (which shed light on both the crustal properties and internal composition). Next, we discuss neutrino emission from proto-neutron stars and how neutrino observations of a supernova, from both current and planned detectors, might impact our knowledge of the interiors, mass and radii of neutron stars. We also explore the question of how superstrong magnetic fields could affect the equation of state and neutron star structure. This is followed by a look at binary mergers involving neutron stars and how the detection of gravity waves could unambiguously distinguish normal neutron stars from self-bound strange quark matter stars.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We determine an empirical dense matter equation of state (EOS) from a heterogeneous data set of six neutron stars: three Type-I X-ray bursters with photospheric radius expansion, studied by Özel et al., and three transient low-mass X-ray binaries. We critically assess the mass and radius determinations from the X-ray burst sources and show explicitly how systematic uncertainties, such as the photospheric radius at touchdown, affect the most probable masses and radii. We introduce a parameterized EOS and use a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm within a Bayesian framework to determine nuclear parameters such as the incompressibility and the density dependence of the bulk symmetry energy. Using this framework we show, for the first time, that these parameters, predicted solely on the basis of astrophysical observations, all lie in ranges expected from nuclear systematics and laboratory experiments. We find significant constraints on the mass–radius relation for neutron stars, and hence on the pressure–density relation of dense matter. The predicted symmetry energy and the EOS near the saturation density are soft, resulting in relatively small neutron star radii around 11–12 km for M = 1.4 M☉. The predicted EOS stiffens at higher densities, however, and our preferred model for X-ray bursts suggests that the neutron star maximum mass is relatively large, 1.9–2.2 M☉. Our results imply that several commonly used equations of state are inconsistent with observations.}

    abstract = { Neutron stars are valuable laboratories for the study of dense matter. Recent observations have uncovered both massive and low-mass neutron stars and have also set constraints on neutron star radii. The largest mass measurements are powerfully influencing the high-density equation of state because of the existence of the neutron star maximum mass. The smallest mass measurements, and the distributions of masses, have implications for the progenitors and formation mechanisms of neutron stars. The ensemble of mass and radius observations can realistically restrict the properties of dense matter and, in particular, the behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy near the nuclear saturation density. Simultaneously, various nuclear experiments are progressively restricting the ranges of parameters describing the symmetry properties of the nuclear equation of state. In addition, new theoretical studies of pure neutron matter are providing insights. These observational, experimental, and theoretical constraints of dense matter, when combined, are now revealing a remarkable convergence. }

title = {Emergent properties of nuclei from ab initio coupled-cluster calculations*},
journal = {Physica Scripta},
abstract = {Emergent properties such as nuclear saturation and deformation, and the effects on shell structure due to the proximity of the scattering continuum and particle decay channels are fascinating phenomena in atomic nuclei. In recent years, ab initio approaches to nuclei have taken the first steps towards tackling the computational challenge of describing these phenomena from Hamiltonians with microscopic degrees of freedom. This endeavor is now possible due to ideas from effective field theories, novel optimization strategies for nuclear interactions, ab initio methods exhibiting a soft scaling with mass number, and ever-increasing computational power. This paper reviews some of the recent accomplishments. We also present new results. The recently optimized chiral interaction NNLO is shown to provide an accurate description of both charge radii and binding energies in selected light- and medium-mass nuclei up to 56Ni. We derive an efficient scheme for including continuum effects in coupled-cluster computations of nuclei based on chiral nucleon–nucleon and three-nucleon forces, and present new results for unbound states in the neutron-rich isotopes of oxygen and calcium. The coupling to the continuum impacts the energies of the  states in O, and—contrary to naive shell-model expectations—the level ordering of the  states in Ca.}

abstract = {We present a comprehensive review of the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IM-SRG), a novel ab initio method for nuclei. The IM-SRG employs a continuous unitary transformation of the many-body Hamiltonian to decouple the ground state from all excitations, thereby solving the many-body problem. Starting from a pedagogical introduction of the underlying concepts, the IM-SRG flow equations are developed for systems with and without explicit spherical symmetry. We study different IM-SRG generators that achieve the desired decoupling, and how they affect the details of the IM-SRG flow. Based on calculations of closed-shell nuclei, we assess possible truncations for closing the system of flow equations in practical applications, as well as choices of the reference state. We discuss the issue of center-of-mass factorization and demonstrate that the IM-SRG ground-state wave function exhibits an approximate decoupling of intrinsic and center-of-mass degrees of freedom, similar to Coupled Cluster (CC) wave functions. To put the IM-SRG in context with other many-body methods, in particular many-body perturbation theory and non-perturbative approaches like CC, a detailed perturbative analysis of the IM-SRG flow equations is carried out. We conclude with a discussion of ongoing developments, including IM-SRG calculations with three-nucleon forces, the multi-reference IM-SRG for open-shell nuclei, first non-perturbative derivations of shell-model interactions, and the consistent evolution of operators in the IM-SRG. We dedicate this review to the memory of Gerry Brown, one of the pioneers of many-body calculations of nuclei.}

abstract = {The description of nuclei starting from the constituent nucleons and the realistic interactions among them has been a long-standing goal in nuclear physics. In addition to the complex nature of the nuclear forces, with two-, three- and possibly higher many-nucleon components, one faces the quantum-mechanical many-nucleon problem governed by an interplay between bound and continuum states. In recent years, significant progress has been made in ab initio nuclear structure and reaction calculations based on input from QCD-employing Hamiltonians constructed within chiral effective field theory. After a brief overview of the field, we focus on ab initio many-body approaches—built upon the no-core shell model—that are capable of simultaneously describing both bound and scattering nuclear states, and present results for resonances in light nuclei, reactions important for astrophysics and fusion research. In particular, we review recent calculations of resonances in the 6He halo nucleus, of five- and six-nucleon scattering, and an investigation of the role of chiral three-nucleon interactions in the structure of 9Be. Further, we discuss applications to the 7Be  radiative capture. Finally, we highlight our efforts to describe transfer reactions including the 3HHe fusion.}

abstract = {We review our knowledge on the properties of the nuclear medium that have been studied, over many years, on the basis of many-body theory, laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations. Throughout the presentation particular emphasis is placed on the possible relationship and links between the nuclear medium and the structure of nuclei, including the limitations of such an approach. First we consider the realm of phenomenological laboratory data and astrophysical observations and the hints they can give on the characteristics that the nuclear medium should possess. The analysis is based on phenomenological models, that however have a strong basis on physical intuition and an impressive success. More microscopic models are also considered, and it is shown that they are able to give invaluable information on the nuclear medium, in particular on its equation of state. The interplay between laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations is particularly stressed, and it is shown how their complementarity enormously enriches our insights into the structure of the nuclear medium. We then introduce the nucleon–nucleon interaction and the microscopic many-body theory of nuclear matter, with a critical discussion about the different approaches and their results. The Landau–Fermi liquid theory is introduced and briefly discussed, and it is shown how fruitful it can be in discussing the macroscopic and low-energy properties of the nuclear medium. As an illustrative example, we discuss neutron matter at very low density, and it is shown how it can be treated within the many-body theory. The general bulk properties of the nuclear medium are reviewed to indicate at which stage of our knowledge we stand, taking into account the most recent developments both in theory and experiments. A section is dedicated to the pairing problem. The connection with nuclear structure is then discussed, on the basis of the energy density functional method. The possibility of linking the physics of exotic nuclei and the astrophysics of neutron stars is particularly stressed. Finally, we discuss the thermal properties of the nuclear medium, in particular the liquid–gas phase transition and its connection with the phenomenology on heavy ion reactions and the cooling evolution of neutron stars. The presentation has been taken for non-specialists and possibly for non-nuclear physicists.}

abstract = {Recent results obtained by applying the method of self-consistent Green’s functions to nuclei and nuclear matter are reviewed. Particular attention is given to the description of experimental data obtained from the (e,e′p) and (e,e′2N) reactions that determine one- and two-nucleon removal probabilities in nuclei since the corresponding amplitudes are directly related to the imaginary parts of the single-particle and two-particle propagators. For this reason and the fact that these amplitudes can now be calculated with the inclusion of all the relevant physical processes, it is useful to explore the efficacy of the method of self-consistent Green’s functions in describing these experimental data. Results for both finite nuclei and nuclear matter are discussed with particular emphasis on clarifying the role of short-range correlations in determining various experimental quantities. The important role of long-range correlations in determining the structure of low-energy correlations is also documented. For a complete understanding of nuclear phenomena it is therefore essential to include both types of physical correlations. We demonstrate that recent experimental results for these reactions combined with the reported theoretical calculations yield a very clear understanding of the properties of all protons in the nucleus. We propose that this knowledge of the properties of constituent fermions in a correlated many-body system is a unique feature of nuclear physics.}

title = "An overview of coupled cluster theory and its applications in physics",
abstract = "What has since become known as the normal coupled cluster method (NCCM) was invented about thirty years ago to calculate ground-state energies of closed-shell atomic nuclei. Coupled cluster (CC) techniques have since been developed to calculate excited states, energies of open-shell systems, density matrices and hence other properties, sum rules, and the sub-sum-rules that follow from imbedding linear response theory within the NCCM. Further extensions deal both with systems at nonzero temperature and with general dynamical behaviour. More recently, a new version of CC theory, the so-called extended coupled cluster method (ECCM) has been introduced. It has the potential to describe such global phenomena as phase transitions, spontaneous symmetry breaking, states of topological excitation, and nonequilibrium behaviour. CC techniques are now widely recognized as providing one of the most universally applicable, most powerful, and most accurate of all microscopic ab initio methods in quantum many-body theory. The number of successful applications within physics is now impressively large. In most such cases the numerical results are either the best or among the best available. A typical case is the electron gas, where the CC results for the correlation energy agree over the entire metallic density range to within less than 1 millihartree (or (or < 1$\%$) with the essentially exact Green's function Monte Carlo results. The role of CC theory within modern quantum many-body theory is first surveyed, by a comparison with other techniques. Its full range of applications in physics is then reviewed. These include problems in nuclear physics, both for finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter; the electron gas; various integrable and nonintegrable models; various relativistic quantum field theories; and quantum spin chain and lattice models. Particular applications of the ECCM include the quantum hydrodynamics of a zero-temperature, strongly-interacting condensed Bose fluid; a charged impurity in a polarizable medium (e.g., positron annihilation in metals); and various anharmonic oscillator and spin systems.",

Many of these systems exhibit phenomena—superconductivity in solids and fission in nuclei, for example—whose understanding does not follow immediately from knowledge of the constituents of the system and the interactions among the constituents, but requires new concepts and ideas. Many‐body physics is the branch of theoretical physics that studies the new phenomena or “emergent properties” that arise from interactions among “elementary” constituents of a many‐particle system and provides means and methods for carrying out precise calculations of such characteristic properties of these systems as may be compared with experimental results to verify hypotheses about the nature of the constituents and their interactions.}",

abstract = {Employing the concept of three-body radial distribution function and using the two-body correlation functions, calculated based on the lowest order constrained variational method, we investigated the effect of the three-body force (TBF) on the nuclear matter properties, for Argonne and Urbana v14 potentials. As such, the results for nuclear matter density, incompressibility, energy per nucleon, and symmetry energy are presented at the saturation point. The inclusion of a phenomenological TBF resulted in closer values of the saturation density, incompressibility, and symmetry energy to the empirical ones for the symmetric nuclear matter. This is especially the case for the Urbana v14 potential. In addition, an empirically-verified parabolic approximation of the interaction energy was utilized to perform an approximate study of the nuclear matter with neutron excess. Hence, at densities higher than about 0.3 fm−3 and for proton-to-neutron density ratios close to the symmetric nuclear matter, the inclusion of TBF resulted in an extra attraction for the Argonne as compared to the Urbana v14 potential.}

Using arguments from perturbation theory to systematically truncate the coupled-cluster singles and CCSD(F12) Lagrangians, a series of coupled-cluster models are proposed and studied that reduce these basis set incompleteness errors through additional single excitations into a complementary auxiliary basis. Convergence with model and size of complementary basis is rapid and there appears to be no need to go beyond second-order models.

The validity of this mass relation is studied globally using the latest mass table. The model is suitable for the extraction of the saturation properties of nuclear matter. The binding energy per nucleon and the saturation Fermi momentum of nuclear matter obtained through this model are 18.33 MeV and 1.48 fm-1 respectively, which agree with the recent many-body calculations of Day (1983). A recurrence relation for eta is derived and is found to have an excellent extrapolation property. Using this property and the energy of the sphere of infinite nuclear matter, it is shown in several representative cases in the periodic table that the masses of nuclei in the far unknown region can be reliably predicted.}

abstract = {Predictions of nuclear properties far from measured data are inherently inaccurate because of uncertainties in our knowledge of nuclear forces and in our treatment of quantum many-body effects in strongly-interacting systems. While the model bias can be directly calculated when experimental data is available, only an estimate can be made in the absence of such measurements. Current approaches to compute the estimated bias quickly lose predictive power when their input variables are taken far from the training region, resulting in uncontrolled uncertainties in applications such as nucleosynthesis simulations. In this letter, we present a novel technique to identify the input variables of machine learning algorithms that can provide robust estimates of model bias. Our process is based on selecting input variables, or features, based on their probability distribution functions across the entire nuclear chart. We illustrate our approach on the problem of quantifying the model bias in nuclear binding energies calculated with Density Functional Theory (DFT). We prove that building model biases with only Z and N as features leads to highly unreliable extrapolations. Conversely, we show that proper feature selection can systematically improve theoretical predictions without increasing uncertainties.}

In this work we present a universal machine learning tool capable of capturing observable-specific convergence patterns independent of nucleus and interaction. We show that, once trained on few-body systems, artificial neural networks can produce accurate predictions for a broad range of light nuclei. In particular, we discuss neural-network predictions of ground-state energies from no-core shell model calculations for Image 1, Image 2 and Image 3 based on training data for Image 4, Image 5 and Image 6 and compare them to classical extrapolations.}

We analyse some of the problems which arise when one extrapolates from properties of finite nuclei to those of infinite nuclear matter. The best way to perform this extrapolation is to use a theory capable of describing both systems on the same footing. Self-consistent calculations using phenomenological effective interactions realize such a program. The general properties of these effective interactions are discussed. The theory we used is described; we emphasize that it accounts for both the properties of the ground states of nuclei and the small amplitude collective vibrations. Simple models of compression modes in infinite nuclear matter and in nuclei are presented; they illustrate various features of the collective modes in both systems. In particular we discuss the role of the shell structure and the effects of the nuclear surface. Results of extensive self-consistent calculations of the breathing mode of nuclei are presented and many features of the mode are analyzed. The role of the single particle spectrum on the frequencies of the collective modes is studied. Finally we briefly review the experimental situation on the monopole excitations of nuclei. We show that experimental data are compatible with a well defined value of the compression modulus of nuclear matter: K∞ = 210±30 MeV.}

We discuss the theoretical interpretation of the coefficients of an A−13 expansion of KA by studying the asymptotic behaviour of two RPA sum rules (corresponding to the scaling and the constrained model), evaluated using self-consistent Thomas-Fermi calculations. We show that the scaling model is the most suitable one as it leads to a rapidly converging A−13 expansion of the corresponding incompressibility KAs, whereas this is not the case with the constrained model. Some semi-empirical relations between the coefficients of the expansion of KAs are established, which reduce to one the number of free parameters in a best-fit analysis of the experimental data. This reduction is essential due to the still limited number and accuracy of experimental data. We then show the compatibility of the data given by the various experimental groups with this parametrization and obtain a value of Kn.m. = 220 ± 20 MeV, in good agreement with more microscopic analyses.}

journal = {Physica Scripta},
abstract = {Emergent properties such as nuclear saturation and deformation, and the effects on shell structure due to the proximity of the scattering continuum and particle decay channels are fascinating phenomena in atomic nuclei. In recent years, ab initio approaches to nuclei have taken the first steps towards tackling the computational challenge of describing these phenomena from Hamiltonians with microscopic degrees of freedom. This endeavor is now possible due to ideas from effective field theories, novel optimization strategies for nuclear interactions, ab initio methods exhibiting a soft scaling with mass number, and ever-increasing computational power. This paper reviews some of the recent accomplishments. We also present new results. The recently optimized chiral interaction NNLO is shown to provide an accurate description of both charge radii and binding energies in selected light- and medium-mass nuclei up to 56Ni. We derive an efficient scheme for including continuum effects in coupled-cluster computations of nuclei based on chiral nucleon–nucleon and three-nucleon forces, and present new results for unbound states in the neutron-rich isotopes of oxygen and calcium. The coupling to the continuum impacts the energies of the  states in O, and—contrary to naive shell-model expectations—the level ordering of the  states in Ca.}

Direct matrix inversion of the Lippman-Schwinger and Brueckner equations is shown to be useful for general nuclear potentials including ones that are local, nonlocal, weak, strong, central, or noncentral. This flexibility is employed to study the relationship between nuclear saturation and the smoothness of the two-nucleon interaction. Five potentials are considered that give approximately equivalent phase shifts but differ in their smoothness. Two examples of smooth potentials with very weak nonlocal tensor terms are given. The potentials are classified according to their smoothness by calculating the wave function defect and the wound integral for each case. The binding energy of nuclear matter is calculated for each potential using the effective mass and angle-averaged Pauli operator approximations. A self-consistent hole spectrum and a free particle spectrum are used. A systematic dependence of saturation on the smoothness of the two-nucleon interaction is found. Only strong potentials with strong tensor terms yield correct saturation, whereas very smooth potentials produce overbinding and large equilibrium densities.}

title = {Ab initio nuclear structure – the large sparse matrix eigenvalue problem},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {The structure and reactions of light nuclei represent fundamental and formidable challenges for microscopic theory based on realistic strong interaction potentials. Several ab initio methods have now emerged that provide nearly exact solutions for some nuclear properties. The ab initio no core shell model (NCSM) and the no core full configuration (NCFC) method, frame this quantum many-particle problem as a large sparse matrix eigenvalue problem where one evaluates the Hamiltonian matrix in a basis space consisting of many-fermion Slater determinants and then solves for a set of the lowest eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors. The resulting eigenvectors are employed to evaluate a set of experimental quantities to test the underlying potential. For fundamental problems of interest, the matrix dimension often exceeds 1010 and the number of nonzero matrix elements may saturate available storage on present-day leadership class facilities. We survey recent results and advances in solving this large sparse matrix eigenvalue problem. We also outline the challenges that lie ahead for achieving further breakthroughs in fundamental nuclear theory using these ab initio approaches.}

It is assumed that only one pion each is exchanged between nucleon (1) and (2), and between (2) and (3), although any number of pions may be emitted and absorbed by the same nucleon. The validity of this calculation is therefore limited to the case when every nucleon is well separated from the other. This three-body potential has a contribution of about 0.22 Mev to the triton binding. In a heavy nucleus the binding energy due to this potential is attractive and about ten percent of that due to two-body interaction. This effect can be roughly stated as follows. Within a nuclear matter the potential between two nucleons takes a different shape due to many body forces. The depth is increased by 9 percent and the range is decreased by 13 percent.}",

ΛCCSD(T) is shown to substantially improve the behavior of CCSD(T) at long bond lengths without significantly affecting the quality of the equilibrium results. Weighted average nonparallelity errors for HF, C2, N2, and H2O are reduced from 22mhartree for CCSD(T) to 10mhartree for ΛCCSD(T). Using ΛCCSD(T) with a Brueckner reference provides the best single reference coupled-cluster description of N2’s dissociation curve to date. Application of CCSD(T) and ΛCCSD(T) to the concerted transition state of 1,3,5-trinitrohexahydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) indicates that this transition state is well described by either methods, and indicates that the activation barrier is too high for it to be a major pathway of decomposition. }",

Four different energy functionals have been considered as a starting point in the derivation: the regular coupled cluster energy expression, the coupled cluster functional incorporating Λ amplitudes, the one constructed via an expectation value coupled cluster method, and that obtained on the basis of the extended coupled cluster method. The proposed corrections have been applied to several small molecules to test their performance compared to full configuration interaction. The fourth-order Λ-based formulas improve upon CCSD(T), (coupled cluster singles and doubles with noniterative triples), while the best fifth-order formulas reduce the fourth-order error by about two-thirds. We also introduce a factorized evaluation of connected T4 in fifth order, which reduces its calculation from an n9 algorithm to n7.

Some of the conclusions concerning the many-body aspects are: 1) It is easy to check convergence properties, with the result that 2) the convergence is very rapid if the necessary conditions are observed, 3) one e.g. violates one of the necessary conditions if one introduces renormalization (occupation probabilities) into hole lines, 4) renormalization in the generalized Brueckner-HF-condition (particle-hole potential) is reasonable.

The introduction of exchange currents into the elastic electron form factor and three body forces greatly improves the situation.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
The chapter discusses the time-independent diagrammatic approach to perturbation theory of fermion systems. The chapter explores the perturbation theory for a non-degenerate level. The formulas derived serves as a starting point for the subsequent consideration of the excitation and ionization energies. The advantages of the direct calculation of excitation energies, compared with the approach in which the total energies of the pertinent electronic states are calculated separately for each state and then the excitation energies are obtained by subtracting the appropriate state energies, are quite obvious. The Rayleigh-Schrödinger (RS) perturbation theory (PT) for the case of a non-degenerate level of some Hamiltonian operator is discussed. The chapter discusses that even the Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation expressions for the direct calculation of the excitation energies may be obtained in a rather simple way without the involvement of the Green function formalism. On the contrary, our simple approach using the ordinary perturbation theory for separate levels presents certain desirable features of the Green function formalism. The chapter explains the diagrammatic representation of Wick's theorem and resulting diagrams. General explicit formulas for the second- and third-order excitation energy contributions are given in the chapter.}

abstract = {Synopsis
The time-independent perturbation theory of quantum mechanics is studied for the case of very large systems, i.e. systems with large spatial dimensions (large volume Ω), and a large number of degrees of freedom. Examples of such systems are met with in the quantum theory of fields, solid state physics, the theory of imperfect gases and in the theory of nuclear matter. Only systems at or near the ground state (i.e., systems at zero temperature) are treated in this paper. In the application of the conventional perturbation theory to such large quantum systems one encounters difficulties which are connected with the fact that even small perturbations produce large changes of the energy and wave function of the whole system. These difficulties manifest themselves through the occurrence of terms containing arbitrarily high powers of the volume Ω in the perturbation expansion of physical quantities. An extremely bad convergence of the perturbation expansion is the result. For the analysis of the Ω-dependence of the terms in the expansion a new formulation of the time-independent perturbation theory is used, which was introduced by Van Hove. Making extensive use of diagrams to represent the different contributions to matrix elements it is possible to locate and separate the Ω-dependent terms, and to carry out partial summations in the original expansion. These separations and summations solve the above difficulties completely. Improved perturbation theoretical expressions are obtained for energies and wave functions of stationary states, as well as for the life-times of metastable states. All terms in these expressions are, in the limit of large Ω, either independent of Ω or proportional to Ω, corresponding to intensive or extensive physical quantities. The convergence of the improved perturbation expansions is no longer affected by the large magnitude of Ω.}

The nucleon-nucleon potential employed contains a weakly repulsive core and yields a satisfactory description of not only the two-nucleon low-energy scattering data but also the essential properties of the deuteron. triton and α-particle. The result shows that the calculated values do generally agree quite well with experimental data. In particular, it is found that, because of the use of totally antisymmetric wave functions, the scattering behavior at large angles is adequately described.}

In this paper, the Bayesian approach to regularization and model-comparison is demonstrated by studying the inference problem of interpolating noisy data. The concepts and methods described are quite general and can be applied to many other data modeling problems. Regularizing constants are set by examining their posterior probability distribution. Alternative regularizers (priors) and alternative basis sets are objectively compared by evaluating the evidence for them. “Occam's razor” is automatically embodied by this process. The way in which Bayes infers the values of regularizing constants and noise levels has an elegant interpretation in terms of the effective number of parameters determined by the data set. This framework is due to Gull and Skilling.}",

abstract = {This paper introduces a general Bayesian framework for obtaining sparse solutions to regression and classification tasks utilising models linear in the parameters. Although this framework is fully general, we illustrate our approach with a particular specialisation that we denote the 'relevance vector machine' (RVM), a model of identical functional form to the popular and state-of-the-art 'support vector machine' (SVM). We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a comparable SVM while offering a number of additional advantages. These include the benefits of probabilistic predictions, automatic estimation of 'nuisance' parameters, and the facility to utilise arbitrary basis functions (e.g. non-'Mercer' kernels). We detail the Bayesian framework and associated learning algorithm for the RVM, and give some illustrative examples of its application along with some comparative benchmarks. We offer some explanation for the exceptional degree of sparsity obtained, and discuss and demonstrate some of the advantageous features, and potential extensions, of Bayesian relevance learning.},

We employ the similarity renormalization group for preparing the Hamiltonian and use coupled-cluster theory to solve the many-body problem for nuclei with closed sub-shells. Through an analysis of theoretical uncertainties resulting from various truncations in this framework, we identify and eliminate the technical hurdles that previously inhibited the step beyond medium-mass nuclei, allowing for reliable validations of nuclear Hamiltonians in the heavy regime. Following this path we show that chiral Hamiltonians qualitatively reproduce the systematics of nuclear ground-state energies up to the neutron-rich Sn isotopes.}

The table combines the results of two working groups, using respectively two different methods of evaluation, published in ADNDT earlier. It presents an updated set of rms charge radii for 909 isotopes of 92 elements from 1H to 96Cm together, when available, with the radii changes from optical isotope shifts. Compared with the last published tables of R-values from 2004 (799 ground states), many new data are added due to progress recently achieved by laser spectroscopy up to early 2011. The radii changes in isotopic chains for He, Li, Be, Ne, Sc, Mn, Y, Nb, Bi have been first obtained in the last years and several isotopic sequences have been recently extended to regions far off stability, (e.g., Ar, Mo, Sn, Te, Pb, Po).}

To illustrate the general theory and to support the claims made the application to several light closed shell nuclei is described in detail. Also other systems are considered briefly. Some of the conclusions concerning the many-body aspects are: 1) It is easy to check convergence properties, with the result that 2) the convergence is very rapid if the necessary conditions are observed, 3) one e.g. violates one of the necessary conditions if one introduces renormalization (occupation probabilities) into hole lines, 4) renormalization in the generalized Brueckner-HF-condition (particle-hole potential) is reasonable. For nuclei two body forces as usual do not yield results in agreement with experiments. The introduction of exchange currents into the elastic electron form factor and three body forces greatly improves the situation.}
