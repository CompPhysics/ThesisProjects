{\bf Project summary:}
In the last few years Coupled-Cluster theory has seen a revival in 
the nuclear structure community. Up until recently Coupled-Cluster 
theory was implemented in an uncoupled scheme (m-scheme). 
Although simple in its form, the m-scheme representation puts
constraints on the size of the model space
and the number particles considered. Recently, Coupled-Cluster with Singles- and Doubles approximation (CCSD)
was derived and implemented in a J-coupled scheme. Taking the spherical 
symmetry of closed shell nuclei into account, and realizing that the
Coupled-Cluster Singles- and Doubles similarity transformed
Hamiltonian has at most two-body terms, an efficient spherical CCSD code was implemented. This 
representation reduces the number of non-linear equations and  the computational cost dramatically, 
allowing us to reach into the medium mass region of the nuclear
chart. 
%Due to the computational cost 
%of the m-scheme representation, the interactions had to be softened by renormalization procedures in order
%to achieve convergence within the model-spaces considered. 
Within the spherical scheme, it is now 
possible to reach convergence of medium mass nuclei starting from ``bare'' interactions. 
Single-reference Coupled-Cluster theory works well for nuclei with closed shells such as $^4$He, $^{16}$O
and $^{40}$Ca, see Ref.~[1], see also 
the recent review of R. Bartlett and M. Musial [2] and the text of Helgaker 
{\em et al} [3] for more information on coupled cluster theory.

Extending Coupled-Cluster theory to infinite matter studies will be a huge step forward allowing for an understanding of nuclear correlations at the levels of
singles, doubles and triples from few nucleons to infinitely many. It will most likely represent the first {\em ab initio}  calculation of infinite matter. 

These calculations will also provide us with insights about missing three-body and more complicated many-body correlations in nuclear systems. The calculations
of Ref.~[1] show that coupled-cluster theory at the level of singles, doubles and and partial triples correlations is size extensive and that the missing
agreement with experiment is mainly due to missing three-body forces in the Hamiltonian.  These three-body contributions stay stable as function of increasing
mass number. If this pertains to infinite matter as well, one can infer 
that three-body correlations or more complicated many-body correlations do not
blow up as one adds more and more particles.  
Calculations of heavier closed-shell nuclei will also be performed as a part of the path towards infinite nuclear matter.

The calculations will be done using our existing coupled-cluster codes written in an angular momentum coupled-scheme, but using interaction matrix elements 
with a plane wave basis, following the recipe outlined in Ref.~[4].

The next step of this thesis, is to use the coupled-cluster calculations
for infinite matter as a basis for constructing a density functional for 
infinite matter, something which has never been done before. These calculations
will thereby mimick the corresponding ones made by Kohn and Sham on the infinite electron gas, see Ref.~[5], calculations which paved the way for the development of the extremely succesful density functional theory. 
The approach which will be chosen for this approach is the so-called adiabatic
approach, see Ref.~[6] for some recent applications.  
Infinite matter is a translationally invariant systems, a feature which allows for rather straightforward applications of the adiabatic approach. 
With these insights, the next aim is to use the results for several 
closed-shell nuclei to compute a corresponding density functional for 
finite nuclei. 

A proper density functional  for nuclei is crucial 

The main issue of the thesis will deal with two-body interactions and equations at the level of 
two-particle-two-hole correlations built from an $N$-particle Slater determinant. However, if time allows, the inclusion of triples and three-body interactions, is an important and actual topic.
