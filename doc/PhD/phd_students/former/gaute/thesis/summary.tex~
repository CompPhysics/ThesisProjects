\chapter{Summary and perspectives}
\label{chap:conclusions}
The main purpose of this thesis has been to study and develop methods 
suitable for study of resonance phenomena in nuclear and subatomic physics. 
Our emphasis has been on the momentum space formulation of the Schr\"odinger
equation. It has been shown, starting with 
the integral formulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, that an efficient way 
of obtaining a complete set of states including bound-, anti-bound and
resonant states is through the Contour Deformation Method. The 
strength of the Contour Deformation Method has been 
illustrated by studying a wide range of different cases in 
subatomic physics where resonance phenomena appear. These
applications ranges from the case of a single particle moving 
in a spherically symmetric field to the case of strong deformations
of the field. Further, it has been studied how resonances may be solved for
in complex potentials which models absorbtive and emittive 
processes, using the Contour Deformation Method. 
The results obtained in these specific applications, strongly favour the 
Contour Deformation Method in comparison with other methods
such as complex coordinate scaling and analytic continuation in the coupling
strength. The most appealing feature of CDM is that, not only does  
it give accurate results for resonances and anti-bound states, but 
in addition it provides us with a complete set of states 
which may be used in many different eigenfunction expansions. 
The only limitation of CDM is that the analytic structure of the
potential has to be known, since the choice of contour has to 
be dictated by the singularity structure of the potential. The 
revival and study of CDM applied to nuclear physics, may 
be considered the main issue of the first part of this thesis, and 
is also the topic of Paper I. 

In the second part of this thesis, the focus is directed towards
the issue of how resonance phenomena may be understood in nuclei, 
where several valence particles are present. The newly developed
Gamow Shell Model is a promising approach in the study of loosely bound and 
unbound nuclei along the drip lines. The main ingredient in the Gamow Shell Model 
is the construction of a complete set of many-body Slater determinants 
built up from a single particle Berggren basis. It has been shown in this
work that a viable starting point in Gamow Shell Model studies is 
to obtain a single particle basis by the Contour Deformation 
Method in momentum space. The results displayed in Paper II, 
indicate rapid convergence for many-body resonances using 
a single particle basis in momentum space.
 


Our emphasis is on the derivation of effective interactions for such systems.
We demonstrated that the construction of an  effective two-body interaction 
based on the Lee-Suzuki similarity transformation method, leads to a drastic
reduction of the Gamow shell-model dimensionality for more than two particles.
This result is promising 
when extending the Gamow shell model to applications in structure 
calculations of heavier dripline nuclei, 
with a larger number of valence particles moving in a large valence space. 

With further progress in computational power   
one may hope that \emph{ab intio}  calculations of light and medium 
size nuclei within the Berggren representation may become possible in the near future. 
Coupled-Cluster techniques has proven to be a promising method for 
calculations of medium size nuclei. 
Very recently \cite{cc1,cc2,cc3}, converged Coupled-Cluster 
results for the ground- and first excited state of $^{16}$O where reported, using 
modern nucleon-nucleon interactions derived from effective field-theory.
A promising way of approach would be 
to generalize the Coupled-Cluster method to complex interactions, and
at the first stage see how resonant structures are formed in light nuclei
starting from an  \emph{ab initio} approach. Another interesting application 
would be to see how single-particle resonances are formed starting from 
a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction.
