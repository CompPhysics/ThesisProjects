\section{The momentum space Schr\"odinger equation.}
\label{sec:momspace}
The Schr\"odinger equation in abstract vector representation is
\begin{equation}
  \left( T + V \right) \vert \psi_n \rangle = E_n \vert\psi_n \rangle 
  \label{eq:vec_rep}
\end{equation}
Here $T$ is the kinetic energy operator and $V$ is the potential operator. 
The eigenstates form a complete orthonormal set according to 
\[ 
{\bf 1} = \sum_n \vert \psi_n\rangle\langle \psi_n \vert, \:\: \langle \psi_n\vert \psi_{n'} \rangle = \delta_{n,n'}
\]
The most commonly used representations of equation~\ref{eq:vec_rep} are the coordinate
and
the momentum space representations. They define the completeness relations 
\begin{eqnarray}
 {\bf 1}&  = &  \int d{\bf r} \:\vert  {\bf r} \rangle \langle {\bf r}\vert, \:\: 
 \langle  {\bf r}\vert  {\bf r'} \rangle = \delta ( {\bf r}-{\bf r'}) \\
{\bf 1} & = & \int d{\bf k} \:\vert  {\bf k} \rangle \langle {\bf k}\vert, \:\: 
  \langle  {\bf k}\vert  {\bf k'} \rangle = \delta ( {\bf k}-{\bf k'}) 
\end{eqnarray}
Here the basis states in  both ${\bf r}$- and ${\bf k}$-space are dirac-delta 
function normalized. From this it follows that the plane-wave states are given by,
\footnote{Some authors define the plane wave by  $ \langle  {\bf r}\vert  {\bf k} \rangle = 
  \exp \left( i {\bf k\cdot r} \right) $, in which case 
  $ \langle  {\bf k}\vert  {\bf k'} \rangle = \left( 2\pi \right)^3 \delta ( {\bf k}-{\bf k'}) $
  and each $\int d{\bf k}$ is replaced by $ (1/2\pi)^{3/2}\int d{\bf k} $.} 
\begin{equation}
  \langle  {\bf r}\vert  {\bf k} \rangle = \left( 1\over2\pi \right)^{3/2}\exp \left( i {\bf k\cdot r} \right)
  \label{eq:planewave1}
\end{equation}
which is a transformation function defining the mapping from the abstract 
$ \vert {\bf k} \rangle $ to the abstract $\vert {\bf r}\rangle $ space.
That the ${\bf r}$-space basis states are 
delta-function normalized follows from 
\begin{equation}
  \delta ( {\bf r}-{\bf r'}) = \langle {\bf r} \vert {\bf r}'\rangle = 
  \langle {\bf r} \vert {\bf 1} \vert {\bf r}'\rangle = 
  \int \mathrm{d}{\bf k} \langle {\bf r}\vert {\bf k} \rangle \langle {\bf k}\vert {\bf r}' \rangle = 
  \left( {1\over 2\pi}\right)^3 \int \mathrm{d}{\bf k} e^{i {\bf k}({\bf r} - {\bf r}')} 
\end{equation}
and the same for the momentum space basis states,
\begin{equation}
  \delta ( {\bf k}-{\bf k'}) = \langle {\bf k} \vert {\bf k}'\rangle = 
  \langle {\bf k} \vert {\bf 1} \vert {\bf k}'\rangle = 
  \int \mathrm{d}{\bf r} \langle {\bf k}\vert {\bf r} \rangle \langle {\bf r}\vert {\bf k}' \rangle = 
  \left( {1\over 2\pi}\right)^3 \int \mathrm{d}{\bf r} e^{i {\bf r}({\bf k} - {\bf k}')} 
\end{equation}
Projecting equation~\ref{eq:vec_rep} on momentum states\footnote{In the literature the momentum states
are often called plane-wave states.},  
the momentum space Schr\"odinger equation is obtained,
\begin{equation}
  {\hbar^2 \over 2\mu} k^2 \psi_n({\bf k})  + 
  \int d{\bf k'}\: V({\bf k}, {\bf k'}) \psi_n({\bf k'}) = 
  E_n \psi_n({\bf k})
  \label{eq:momspace1}
\end{equation}
Here the notation $\psi_n({\bf k}) = \langle {\bf k} \vert \psi_n\rangle $ and 
$ \langle {\bf k} \vert V \vert {\bf k}' \rangle = V({\bf k}, {\bf k'})$ has been introduced.
The potential in momentum space is given by a double Fourier-transform 
of the potential in coordinate space, i.e.
\begin{equation} 
  V ({\bf k}, {\bf k'}) = \left( {1\over 2\pi}\right)^3 \int \mathrm{d}{\bf r}\int \mathrm{d}{\bf r}'\: 
  e^{-i {\bf kr} }V({\bf r},{\bf r}') e^{i{\bf k}'{\bf r}'}  
\end{equation}
Here it is assumed that the potential interaction does not contain any spin dependence. 
Instead of a differential equation in coordinate space, the Schr\"odinger
equation becomes an integral equation in momentum space. This has 
many tractable features. Firstly, most realistic 
nucleon-nucleon interactions derived from field-theory are given 
explicitly in momentum space. Secondly, the boundary conditions imposed
on the differential equation in coordinate space are automatically built into the
integral equation. And last, but not least, integral equations are easy to numerically 
implement, and convergence is obtained by just increasing the number of integration
points.
Instead of solving the three-dimensional integral equation given in equation~(\ref{eq:momspace1}), an 
infinite set of 1-dimensional equations can be obtained by invoking a partial wave
expansion. 
The wave function $ \psi_n({\bf k}) $ can be expanded in a complete set of spherical harmonics, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
  \psi_n({\bf k}) = \sum _{lm} \psi_{nlm}(k)Y_{lm} (\hat{k}), \:\:
  \psi_{nlm}(k) = \int d\hat{k} Y_{lm}^*(\hat{k})\psi_n({\bf k}).   
  \label{eq:part_wave1}
\end{equation}
By inserting equation~\ref{eq:part_wave1} in equation~\ref{eq:momspace1}, and projecting from the left
$Y_{lm}(\hat{k})$, the three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation~(\ref{eq:momspace1}) is reduced
to an infinite set of  1-dimensional angular momentum coupled integral equations, 
\begin{equation}
  \left( {\hbar^2 \over 2\mu} k^2 - E_{nlm}\right) \psi_{nlm}(k) =  
  -\sum_{l'm'} \int_{0}^\infty dk' {k'}^2 V_{lm, l'm'}(k,k') \psi_{nl'm'}(k') 
  \label{eq:part_wave2}
\end{equation}
where the angular momentum projected potential takes the form,
\begin{equation}
  V_{lm, l'm'}(k,k') = \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{k}} \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{k}'}\: 
    Y_{lm}^*(\hat{k})V({\bf k}, {\bf k'})Y_{l'm'}(\hat{k}')
    \label{eq:pot1}
\end{equation}
here $\mathrm{d}{\hat k} = \mathrm{d}\theta \sin\theta \:\mathrm{d}\varphi $.
In many cases the potential is given in position space, so it is convinient to establish 
the connection between $V_{lm, l'm'}(k,k')$ and $V_{lm, l'm'}(r,r')$. Inserting 
position space completeness in equation~(\ref{eq:pot1}) gives
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber
  V_{lm, l'm'}(k,k') = \int \mathrm{d}{\bf{r}} \int \mathrm{d}{\bf{r}'}\: 
  \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{k}} \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{k}'}\: 
  Y_{lm}^*(\hat{k})\langle {\bf k}\vert {\bf r} \rangle
  \langle{\bf r}  \vert V \vert {\bf r}' \rangle
  \langle {\bf r'}\vert {\bf k}' \rangle Y_{lm}(\hat{k}') = \\
  \int \mathrm{d}{\bf{r}} \int \mathrm{d}{\bf{r}'}\: 
  \left\{ \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{k}}  Y_{lm}^*(\hat{k})\langle {\bf k}\vert {\bf r} \rangle \right\}
  \langle{\bf r}  \vert V \vert {\bf r}' \rangle
  \left\{ \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{k}'}\:   Y_{lm}(\hat{k}') \langle {\bf r'}\vert {\bf k}' \rangle\right\}
  \label{eq:pot2}
\end{eqnarray}
Since the plane waves depend only on the absolute values of position and momentum, 
$ \vert {\bf k} \vert, \vert {\bf r} \vert  $,
and the angle between them, $ \theta_{kr} $, they may be expanded in terms of bipolar harmonics of 
zero rank \cite{biedenharn}, i.e.  
\begin{equation} 
  e^{i {\bf k}\cdot {\bf r}} = 4\pi \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} i^l j_l(kr)\left( Y_l(\hat{k}) \cdot Y_l(\hat{r}) \right)
  = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1)i^l j_l(kr) P_l(\cos \theta_{kr}) 
\end{equation}
Where the addition theorem for spherical harmonics has been used in order to write
the expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials. The spherical Bessel functions, $j_l(z)$,  
are given in terms of Bessel functions of the first kind with half integer orders \cite{gradshteyn,stegun},  
\[
j_l(z) = \sqrt{\pi \over 2 z} J_{l+1/2}(z).  
\]
Inserting the plane-wave expansion
into the brackets of equation~(\ref{eq:pot2}) yields, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber
  \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{k}}  Y_{lm}^*(\hat{k})\langle {\bf k}\vert {\bf r} \rangle & = &  
  \left( {1\over 2\pi} \right) ^{3/2}4\pi i^{-l} j_l(kr) Y_{lm}^*(\hat{r}), \\  
  \nonumber
  \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{k}'}\:   Y_{lm}(\hat{k}') \langle {\bf r'}\vert {\bf k}' \rangle & = &  
  \left( {1\over 2\pi} \right) ^{3/2}4\pi i^{l'} j_{l'}(k'r') Y_{l'm'}(\hat{r}). 
\end{eqnarray}
The connection between the momentum- and position space angular momentum 
projected potentials are then given, 
\begin{equation}
  V_{lm, l'm'}(k,k') = {2 \over \pi} i^{l' -l}\int_0^\infty dr\: r^2 \int_0^\infty dr'\: {r'}^2 
  j_l(kr) V_{lm,l'm'}(r,r') j_{l'}(k'r')
  \label{eq:pot3}
\end{equation}
which is known as a double Fourier-Bessel transform. The position space angular 
momentum projected potential is given by,
\begin{equation}
  V_{lm, l'm'}(r,r') = \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{r}} \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{r}'}\: 
  Y_{lm}^*(\hat{r})V({\bf r}, {\bf r'})Y_{l'm'}(\hat{r}').
  \label{eq:pot4}
\end{equation}
No assumptions of locality/non-locality and deformation of the interaction has so far been made, 
and the result in equation~(\ref{eq:pot3}) is general. In position space the Schr\"odinger equation 
takes form of an integro-differential equation in case of a non-local interaction, 
in momentum space the Schr\"odinger equation is an ordinary integral equation of the Fredholm type, 
see equation~(\ref{eq:part_wave2}). This is a further advantage of the momentum space approach as compared to 
the standard position space approach.  
If we assume that the 
interaction is of local character, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
  \nonumber
  \langle {\bf r}\vert V \vert {\bf r'}\rangle = V({\bf r}) \delta( {\bf r}-{\bf r}' ) = 
  V({\bf r}) {\delta( { r}-{r}' ) \over r^2} \delta ( \cos \theta - \cos \theta' ) \delta (\varphi-\varphi'), 
\end{equation}
then equation~(\ref{eq:pot4}) reduces to 
\begin{equation}
  V_{lm, l'm'}(r,r') = {\delta( { r}-{r}' ) \over r^2}\int \mathrm{d}{\hat{r}}\:
  Y_{lm}^*(\hat{r})V({\bf r})Y_{l'm'}(\hat{r}),
  \label{eq:pot5}
\end{equation}
and equation~(\ref{eq:pot3}) reduces to  
\begin{equation}
  V_{lm, l'm'}(k,k') = {2 \over \pi} i^{l' -l}\int_0^\infty dr\: r^2 \:
  j_l(kr) V_{lm,l'm'}(r) j_{l'}(k'r)
  \label{eq:pot6}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
  V_{lm, l'm'}(r) = \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{r}}\:
  Y_{lm}^*(\hat{r})V({\bf r})Y_{l'm'}(\hat{r}),
  \label{eq:pot10}
\end{equation}
In the case that the interaction is central, $V({\bf r}) = V(r)$, then
\begin{equation}
  V_{lm, l'm'}(r) = V(r) \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{r}}\:
  Y_{lm}^*(\hat{r})Y_{l'm'}(\hat{r}) = V(r) \delta_{l,l'}\delta_{m,m'},
  \label{eq:pot7}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
  V_{lm, l'm'}(k,k') = {2 \over \pi} \int_0^\infty dr\: r^2 \:
  j_l(kr) V(r) j_{l'}(k'r)\delta_{l,l'}\delta_{m,m'} = 
  V_l(k,k') \delta_{l,l'}\delta_{m,m'}
  \label{eq:pot8}
\end{equation}
where the momentum space representation of the interaction finally reads,
\begin{equation}
  V_{l}(k,k') = {2 \over \pi} \int_0^\infty dr\: r^2 \:
  j_l(kr) V(r) j_{l}(k'r).
  \label{eq:pot9}
\end{equation}
For a local and spherical symmetric potential, 
the coupled momentum space Schr\"odinger equations given in equation~(\ref{eq:part_wave2})
decouples in angular momentum, 
giving
\begin{equation}
  {\hbar^2 \over 2\mu} k^2 \psi_{n l}(k) + 
  \int_{0}^\infty dk' {k'}^2 V_{l}(k,k') \psi_{n l }(k') =
  E_{n l} \psi_{n l}(k) 
  \label{eq:momentum_space}
\end{equation}   
Where we have written $\psi_{n l }(k) = \psi_{nlm}(k)$, since the 
equation becomes independent of the projection $m$ for spherical symmetric interactions. 
The momentum space wave functions $\psi_{n l}(k) $ defines a complete orthogonal set 
of functions, which spans the space of functions with a positive finite Euclidean norm 
 (also called $l^2$-norm), $ \sqrt{ \langle \psi_n \vert \psi_n \rangle} $, which 
is a Hilbert space. The corresponding normalized wave function in coordinate space
is given by the Fourier-Bessel transform 
\begin{equation}
  \phi_{n l}(r)  = \sqrt{ 2\over \pi}\int dk\: k^2 j_l(kr) \psi_{n l}(k)
\end{equation}

\section{Analytic continuation of momentum space Schr\"odinger equation by CDM}
\label{sec:analytic_continuation}
In Chapter~\ref{chap:gentheory} it was shown how the generalized Berggren completeness
relations may be derived from the completeness relation defined on the physical energy sheet
using analytic continuation techniques to reach into the non-physical energy sheet. 
Having obtained a generalized completeness relation, the corresponding eigenvalue
problem may easily be deduced. On the other hand one may start with the 
eigenvalue problem for bound- and scattering scates, and investigate under 
which conditions the Schr\"odinger equation may be continued to the non-physical 
energy sheet where the most interesting continuum phenomena, i.e. the resonance phenomena, 
are located. In this section we outline a method which analytically continue the
momentum space Schr\"odinger equation through the unitarity cut onto the second 
Riemann sheet of the complex energy plane, which is based on deforming the integration
contour. This method is known as the \emph{contour deformation (distortion) method} (CDM).  
The contour deformation method was first introduced in the study of the full off-shell 
scattering amplitudes
in two- and three particle scattering in the early 60's, see Refs.~\cite{tikto,nuttal2,nuttal1,nuttal}. 
A rotation of the integration contour in the 
momentum space integral equations extended the domain over which the integral kernel 
is a compact (Schmidt)-operator. This has numerical advantages as the kernel is no longer
singular. In 1954 Wick \cite{wick}  introduced the method of contour
rotation in momentum space; in transforming the equation to the imaginary axis
the strong singularities of the interaction kernel where avoided. A
rotation of the contour in momentum space has therefore often been referred to as 
Wick rotation. The contour deformation method has therefore two important
applications, first the Schr\o dinger equation is analytically continued onto
the non-physical sheet revealing resonant structures and secondly 
it provides a method for making the integral kernels compact enabling
stable numerical solutions for the scattering amplitudes.

In the following we consider the momentum space Schr\o dinger equation given in 
equation~(\ref{eq:part_wave2}) where the potential is assumed spherically symmetric and
with no spin- or tensor components. 
Equation~\ref{eq:momentum_space} may be rewritten as an integral equation for the bound states 
\begin{equation}
\psi_{nl}(k) = {1\over E_{nl} - k^2/2\mu }\int_{0}^{\infty} 
dk' {k'}^{2}V_{l}(k,k')\psi_{nl}(k').
\label{eq:boundstate}
\end{equation}
For real $k,k'$ this equation is defined on the physical energy sheet, 
i.e. in the upper half complex $k$-plane. 
If this equation to describe a resonant or
anti bound state, it has to be anlytically continued through the branch cut along the real 
energy axis and onto the non-physical energy sheet, defined as the lower half complex $k$-plane. 

The most straightforward method of analytic continuation is by use of power 
series. Consider a function $f(z)$ analytic in the domain $D$, 
and let $f_1$  and $f_2$ be taylor series of $f(z)$ about $z_0$ and $z_0'$ 
on domains $D_1$ and $D_2$, respectively,
\[ f_1(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(z-z_0)^n, \:\:\: 
 f_2(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n(z-{z'}_0)^n
\]
Both domains $D_1$ and $D_2$ are in $D$, and the radius of convergence 
is determined by distance from $z_0$ and $z_0'$ to the nearest point on 
the boundary of analyticity region $D$. Further suppose that the intersection $D_1 \cap D_2 $ 
is not empty and that $f_1 = f_2 $ on $D_1 \cap D_2 $ . 
Then $f_2$ is called an analytic continuation $f_1$ of  to $D_2$, 
and vice versa. This procedure may be iterated to obtain the values of $f(z)$ in the
entire domain $D$ based on its values in the subdomains $D_1,D_2,...$.

Consider now the analytic continuation of the bound state equation given in equation~(\ref{eq:boundstate}). 
In analytic continuation of integral equations we state the general rule, 
see for example \cite{kukulin,newton}: \\
\emph{Continuing an integral in the complex plane, the moving singularities of the
integrand must not intercept the integration contour.} \\
First of all, it is seen that the analytic properties of $\psi_{nl}(k)$ 
is determined by the interaction, $V_l(k,q)$ entering the integral kernel. 
The analytic continuation of equation~(\ref{eq:boundstate}) to the lower 
half complex energy plane is a stepwise process where overlapping domains of analyticity
are created. Each step of analytic continuation of the bound state Schr\"odinger equation to 
the lower half complex energy plane involves the following three steps:  
\begin{enumerate}
\item The analyticity domain, $D_1$, for the wavefunction $\psi_{nl}(k)$ is determined. 
The analyticity of $\psi(k) $
is given by the potential $V(k,q)$, where in the first step $q$ is defined along the real axis.
\item Having determined the analyticity region $D_1$ in the lower half
$k$-plane, the integration in $q$ along the real axis may be distorted 
onto a contour $L_1^+$ in the lower half complex $k$-plane, using the Cauchy integral formula. 
All points on the contour $L_1^+$ must be contained in the analyticity domain $D_1$.  
\item A new analyticity domain $D_2$ is determined for the
wavefunction $\psi(k)$. The domain $D_2$ is again determined by the
singularity structure of the potential $V(k,q) $ where $q$ is now on the distorted contour $L_1^+$. 
If and only if the contour $L_1^+ $ also lies in the new domain of analyticity $D_2$, 
we may choose $k$ on $L_1^+$ as well. This gives a closed integral equation, 
and the Schr\"odinger  equation is transformed onto the contour $L_1^+$.  
\end{enumerate} 
This process of analytic continuation may be continued iteratively 
uncovering larger domains of interest in the complex energy plane.
The contour  $L^+$ start at $k=0$, and is therefore by definition 
part of the inversion symmetric contour $L=L^- + L^+$. 
The analytically continued equation~(\ref{eq:momentum_space}) on a general inversion symmetric contour then 
takes the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:neweq1}
	{\hbar^{2}\over 2\mu}k^2\psi_{nl}(k) + {2\over\pi}\int_{L^{+}} 
	dk' {k'}^{2}V_{l}(k,k')\psi_{nl}(k') = E_{nl}\psi_{nl}(k).
\end{equation}
Here both $k$ and $k'$ are defined on the inversion symmetric contour $L^+$ in the lower
half complex $k$-plane, giving a closed integral equation. 
\footnote{See  Paper I for an application of CDM to the solution of
anti-bound and resonant states and scattering in the Malfliet-Tjon potential.}
The analytically continued wave functions $\psi_{n l }(k) $ defines a complete bi-orthogonal set 
of functions, which spans the space of functions with exponential asymptotics in the domain 
above the inversion symmetric contour $L^+$, see also Chapter~\ref{chap:gentheory}.
The wave functions are normalized 
according to the generalized inner product (c-product), 
see e.g. \cite{nimrod,berggren1}
\begin{equation}
  \int_{L^+} dk k^2 \psi_{n l }(k)\psi_{n' l }(k) = \delta_{n,n'}
  \label{eq:norm1}
\end{equation}
The corresponding normalized wave function in coordinate space
is given by the Fourier-Bessel transform 
\begin{equation}
  \phi_{n l}(r)  = \sqrt{ 2\over \pi}\int dk\: k^2 j_l(kr) \psi_{n l}(k)
\end{equation}  
the orthogonality of the coordinate wave functions is easily proved using the orthogonality 
of the spherical Bessel functions \cite{gradshteyn},
\begin{equation}
  \int dr\: r^2 j_l(kr) j_l(k'r) = {\pi \over 2} { \delta (k-k')\over kk'}. 
\end{equation}
Equation~(\ref{eq:neweq1}) is analytically solvable for only a limiting class of potenials.
Newton \cite{newton} proved that for all separable potentials, 
equation~(\ref{eq:neweq1}) admits solutions in closed forms. 
In most practical applications the solutions have to be approximated 
numerically.  This is for example the case for the Woods-Saxon potential which
is widely used in nuclear physics. 
In solving equation~\ref{eq:neweq1} numerically, one chooses a set of 
$N$ grid points in $k-$space by some quadrature rule, e.g. Gauss-Legendre.
The integral is then discretized by $\int dk \rightarrow \sum_{i=1}^N w_i $.
On the chosen grid, equation~\ref{eq:neweq1} takes the form 
\begin{equation}
  {\hbar^2 \over 2\mu} k_i^2  \psi_{n l}(k_i) + \sum_j^N w_j k_j^2 V_{l}(k_i,k_j) \psi_{n l }(k_j) 
  =  E_{n l} \psi_{n l}(k_i)
  \label{eq:momentum_space2}
\end{equation}
this equation represents a non-symmetric eigenvalue problem which is easily 
solved numerically. As most diagonalization routines are optimized for
specific classes of matrices, it would be preferable to obtain a symmetric 
matrix, in the complex case the computational cost is 
drastically reduced if the matrix to be diagonalized 
can be made symmetric, see e.g. \cite{ilonbar1,ilonbar2,ilonbar3}. 
Equation~\ref{eq:momentum_space2} is easily made
symmetric by multiplying through with $\sqrt{w_i} k_i$. Defining 
$ {\psi}_{n l}(i) \equiv  \sqrt{w_i} k_i \psi_{n l }(k_i) $, 
one gets the symmetric eigenvalue problem,
\begin{equation}
  {\hbar^2 \over 2\mu} k_i^2 {\psi}_{n l}(i) + 
  \sum_j^N \sqrt{w_i w_j} k_i k_j V_{l}(k_i,k_j) {\psi}_{n l }(j) 
  =  E_{n l} {\psi}_{n l}(i)
  \label{eq:momentum_space3}
\end{equation}
The norm integral in equation~(\ref{eq:norm1}) becomes the discrete sum
\begin{equation}
  \delta_{n, n'} = 
  \sum_{i=1}^N {\psi}_{n l }(i) {\psi}_{n' l }(i) = 
  \sum_{i=1}^N w_i k_i^2 {\psi}_{n l }(k_i) {\psi}_{n' l }(k_i), 
\end{equation}
and the discretized completeness relation then takes the form
\begin{equation}
  {\bf 1} = 
  \sum_{n}^N \vert {\psi}_{n l }\rangle\langle{\psi}_{n l }^*\vert  = 
  \sum_{n}^N \sum_{i=1}^N {\psi}_{n l }(i){\psi}_{n l }(i)
  \label{eq:unity2}
\end{equation}
Changing from a continuous to a discrete plane-wave basis, it becomes transparent that
the coordinate wave function is an expansion in a basis of spherical-Bessel functions
 \begin{equation}
   \phi_{n l}(r)  = \sqrt{ 2\over \pi}\sum_{i=1}^N \sqrt{w_i}k_i j_l(k_ir) {\psi}_{n l}(i)
\end{equation}  
where ${\psi}_{n l}(i)$ are the expansion coefficients.
Defining the functions 
\begin{equation}
  f_l(k_i r) = \sqrt{2 \over \pi} \sqrt{w_i} k_i j_l(k_i r)
\end{equation}
and using the discrete representation of the Dirac-delta function 
\begin{equation}
  \delta (k-k') \rightarrow {\delta _{k_i,k_j}\over \sqrt{w_i w_j}}
\end{equation}
we get the expansion 
\begin{equation}
   \phi_{n l}(r)  = \sum_{i=1}^N {\psi}_{n l}(i) f_l(k_ir) 
\end{equation}  
where it is easily seen that the functions $f_l(k_i r) $ are orthogonal for different $k_i$ 
and normalized
\begin{equation}
  \int dr \: r^2 f_l(k_i r)f_l(k_jr )= \delta_{k_i, k_j}
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{k_i, k_j} $ is the Kronecker delta.
The eigenfunctions satisfy the general Berggren completeness relation discussed in
the previous sections, and constitute a \emph{bi-orthogonal} set and
are normalized according to the general $c$-product. 
Collecting the results from the discussion on the Berggren completeness relation in the 
previous section, and on the analytic continuation of the momentum space Schr\"odinger equaiton 
by CDM, the choice of contour in the complex $k$-plane must therefore be based on the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item The contour must be \emph{ inversion symmetric}. 
\item The contour must be located in overlapping domains of analyticity, 
see step (iii) above, and the wavefunction must admit analytic continuation onto 
the contour $L^+$. 
\item The choice of contour must be based on an 
\emph{a posteriori} knowledge of poles in each partial wave of the scattering matrix.
\end{itemize}

\section{Single particle resonances in a deformed field}
\label{sec:deformed}
In this section we will consider formation of resonances in an 
axially deformed field. The study of resonances in deformed fields
has so far only been considered on rare occuations. In Ref.~\cite{deform1}
energy levels and conditions for bound states to become resonances and 
resonances to become bound states were investigated for an 
axially deformed Woods-Saxon potentialm, by solving the 
the radial Schr\"odinger for coupled channels with outgoing asymptotics.
However, the coupled channels method used in Ref.~\cite{deform1} 
does not easily generalize to the non-resonant continuum. This implies
that a complete Berggren basis in a deformed field is difficult to obtain, 
and all evaluated observables will become complex quantities unless
the non-resonant continuum is taken properly into account. 
In Ref.~\cite{deform2} a different approach were considered. Their aim was
to propose a method to obtain scattering wave functions in the vicinity of a 
multi-channel resonance on the real axis. 
Then calculate the phase shifts, and investigate
whether a resonance condition is met. Further this method allows for 
evaluation of observables where the continuum is properly taken into 
account, and they become real quantities. Here we propose 
an alternative method, starting with the momentum space Schr\"odinger equation 
given in equation~(\ref{eq:momspace1}). The obvious advantage of this, is that 
the boundary conditions are automatically built into the integral equations, 
further we will show that a single particle Berggren basis taken 
into account all non-resonant continuum states is possible to obtain
within this approach.

We consider an axially deformed Gaussian potential with no spin and 
tensor components. In spherical coordinates it is given as 
\begin{equation} 
  V(r,\theta) = V_0 \exp\left( -r^2( \alpha \cos^2\theta +\beta \sin^2\theta ) \right) 
  \label{eq:sph1}
\end{equation}  
or in cartesian coordinates, 
\begin{equation} 
  V(x,y,z) = V_0 \exp\left( -\beta (x^2 + y^2)\right) \exp(-\alpha z^2) 
  \label{eq:cartesian1} 
\end{equation}  
here $V_0$ is the strength of the potential and $\alpha $ and $\beta $ are shape
parameters. In the case $ \alpha = \beta $ the potential is just a spherical 
Gaussian potential. In the case $ \alpha > \beta $ the potential field is stretched  
out in the $x,y$-plane, and defines an \emph{oblate} shape. In the case $\alpha < \beta $ 
the potential field is stretched out in along the $z$-axis, and defines a \emph{prolate} shape. 
Defining a deformation parameter $\delta$ in the following way, 
\begin{equation}
  \delta = 1 - { \alpha \over \beta }, 
\end{equation}
equation~(\ref{eq:sph1}) can be written in the form, 
\begin{equation}
  V(r,\theta;\: \beta, \delta ) = V_0 \exp (-\beta r^2) \exp( \beta \delta r^2 \cos^2\theta) = 
  V(r; \: \beta) D(r,\theta;\: \beta, \delta )
  \label{eq:deform1}
\end{equation}
Here $V(r; \: \beta) $ 
is a spherically symmetric formfactor and $ D(r,\theta;\: \beta, \delta ) $ 
a deformation formfactor.
We require that the volume of the central potential, with the shape parameter
$\alpha_0 = \alpha = \beta $, is equal to the volume of the axially 
deformed potential. This gives implies that the shape 
parameters of the non-central and central Gaussian potential satisfy the 
following relation,
\begin{equation}
  \alpha \beta^2 = \alpha_0^3 
\end{equation} 
In figure~\ref{fig:deform1} a plot of the isocurves $V(r,\theta) = 0.5 $ are shown in 
the $x,z$-plane for the deformation parameters $\delta = \pm 0.5$.  $\delta = 0.5 $ 
gives 
the shape parameters for the deformed potential $ \alpha = 2^{-2/3}$ 
and $\beta = 2^{1/3}$,
and $\delta = 0.5 $ 
gives 
the parameters $ \alpha = (3/2)^{2/3}$ and $\beta = (2/3)^{1/3}$.
Here potential parameters $\alpha_0 = 1$ 
and $V_0 = 1$ 
are used. It is
seen that $ \delta = 0.5 $ 
corresponds to an \emph{oblate} shape, where the field is
stretched out in the $x,y$-plane. For $\delta = -0.5 $ 
the potential takes a \emph{prolate}
shape, where the field is stretched out along the symmetry axis ($z$-axis). 
\begin{figure}[hbtp]

	      {\epsfig{file=figures/deform1.eps}} 
  \end{center}
  \caption{Plot of isocurves $V(r,\theta) = 0.5 $ of the deformed potential for deformation
    $\delta = \pm 0.5 $ with potential strength $V_0 = 1$ in the $x,z$-plane. 
    For the spherically
    symmetric potential a  shape parameter $\alpha_0 = 1 $ were chosen.}
  \label{fig:deform1}
\end{figure}
In order to assess the shape structure in more detail, it is
instructive to study the multipole components of the potential.    
An axially symmetric potential may be expanded in terms
of Legendre polynomials, i.e.  
\begin{equation}
  V(r,\theta) = \sum_\lambda V_\lambda(r) P_\lambda ( \cos\theta) 
  \label{eq:multipoles}
\end{equation}
the multipole components are then given by the  integrals 
\begin{equation}
  V_\lambda(r) = { (2\lambda + 1) \over 2} V_0 \exp (-\beta r^2) \int_{-1}^1 dx \:
  \exp( \beta \delta r^2 x^2 ) P_\lambda(x) 
\end{equation}
Here it is explicitly seen that only \emph{even} multipoles give non-vanishing 
contributions, since the Legendre polynomials have the 
property 
\[
 P_\lambda(-x) = (-1)^\lambda P_\lambda(x),
\]
and the potential is an even function in $x$. 
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \begin{center}
    \resizebox{16cm}{8cm}{\epsfig{file=figures/multi_poles.eps}}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Plot of $\lambda = 0,2,4$ multipoles of the Gaussian potential 
    with deformation parameters $\delta = 0.5$ (right plot) and $\delta = -0.5$  
    (left plot)  and $\alpha_0 = 1 $}
\label{fig:multi1}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:multi1} gives a plot of the 
$\lambda = 0,2,4$ multipoles of the Gaussian potential  
with deformation parameters $\delta = \pm 0.5$. It is seen that the radial monopole 
distribution is more or less identical for $\delta = 0.5 $ and $\delta = -0.5$. 
From the  volume conservation imposed on the deformed potential, it 
follows that the volume of the monopole part of the potential is independent of the 
deformation parameter $\delta $. 
This is easy to show, since  $P_\lambda(\cos\theta) = Y_{\lambda 0}(\theta, \varphi)$
and using the well known property of the spherical harmonics (see e.g. \cite{varshalovich} ), 
\begin{equation}
  \int d\hat{r} Y_{lm}(\hat{r}) = \sqrt{4 \pi}\delta_{l,0}\delta_{m,0}
\end{equation}
from which it follows directly, 
\begin{equation}
\int dV\: V({\bf r}) = \int_0^\infty dr\: r^2V_{\lambda = 0}(r)
\end{equation}
Further it is seen that the deformed Gaussian potential 
is nearly a pure quadrupole deformation, since the $\lambda =4$ 
multipole is almost vanishing in both cases. This may be understood
from considering the exponent of the deformed formfactor in equation~(\ref{eq:deform1}),
which can be rewrittin in terms of the $ Y_{20}(\hat{r}) $ spherical harmonic.

Having discussed the shape and multipoles of the deformed Gaussian potential, 
we now turn to the acually solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for 
this potential. We wish to solve the 
momentum space Schr\"odinger equation given in equation~(\ref{eq:momspace1}).
The Fourier transformation of the deformed 
Gaussian potential in equation~(\ref{eq:cartesian1})
is, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber
  V(q_x,q_y,q_z) & = &  {V_0 \over (2\pi)^3 }\int dx \:dy \:dz\: 
  \exp\left( i( q_x x +q_y y +q_z z) \right) 
  \exp\left( -\beta (x^2 + y^2) -\alpha z^2 \right) \\ 
  &  = &{V_0 \over 8 \pi^{3/2} \beta \alpha^{1/2} }
  \exp\left( -{1\over 4 \beta}(q_x^2 +q_y^2) \right)   
  \exp\left( -{1\over 4 \alpha} q_z^2 \right)
\end{eqnarray}
here $q_i= k_i - k_i',\: i = x,y,z$. In terms of spherical coordinates $k,\theta, \varphi $  
the potential takes the form, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber
  V({\bf k},{\bf k}')&  = & {V_0 \over 8 \pi^{3/2} \beta \alpha^{1/2} }
  \exp\left( -{1\over 4 \beta} ( k^2 \sin^2\theta + {k'}^2\sin^2\theta')
  -{1\over 4 \alpha} ( k^2 \cos^2\theta - {k'}^2\cos^2\theta')^2\right) \\
  & \times & \exp\left( -{1\over 4 \beta } kk'\sin\theta\sin\theta' \cos\left( \varphi - \varphi'\right) \right)
  \label{eq:sph2}
\end{eqnarray} 
due to axial symmetry the  dependence of the potential 
on the azimuthal angles $\varphi, \varphi' $ is only the difference 
$ \omega = \varphi - \varphi'$. The potential may therefore be expanded in 
a complete set of harmonics, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
  V( {\bf k}, {\bf k'}) = \sum_{\mu = -\infty}^\infty V_{\mu}(\tilde{k}, \tilde{k}') \exp(i \mu \omega), 
  \label{eq:pot_exp1}
\end{equation}
here $\tilde{k} = k,\theta $. 
The harmonics $\exp ( i\mu \omega )$ obey the orthogonality relation 
\begin{equation}
  \int_{-\pi}^\pi d\omega \: \exp (-i\mu \omega) \exp( i\mu'\omega) = 2\pi \delta_{\mu,\mu'}
\end{equation}
the $\mu$'th harmonic of the potential is therefore given by the integral
\begin{equation}
  V_\mu( \tilde{k},\tilde{k}') = 
    {1 \over 2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi d\omega \:\exp(-i\mu \omega) V({\bf k},{\bf k}')
\end{equation}
From equation~(\ref{eq:sph2}) it is seen, that for the integral over $\omega $, 
we have to consider the following integral, 
\begin{equation}
  I_{\mu}(y) = {1 \over 2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi d\omega \:\exp(-i\mu \omega) 
  \exp( y \cos\omega ) = {1\over \pi} \int_0^\pi d\omega \: \cos( \mu \omega) \exp(y \cos\omega ) 
  \label{eq:bessel1}
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the variable 
\[
y = {1\over 2\beta } kk'\sin\theta\sin\theta'.
\]
The integral in equation~(\ref{eq:bessel1}) is just the definition of the modified Bessel 
function of the 1'st kind (see e.g. \cite{stegun}). 
The $\mu$'th harmonic of the potential is analytic form given by, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber
  V_\mu( \tilde{k},\tilde{k}') = {V_0 \over 8 \pi^{3/2} \beta \alpha^{1/2} } \times  \\
  \exp\left( -{1\over 4 \beta} ( k^2 \sin^2\theta - {k'}^2\sin^2\theta')^2
  -{1\over 4 \alpha} ( k^2 \cos^2\theta - {k'}^2\cos^2\theta')^2\right) 
  \exp(-y) I_{\mu}(y)
\end{eqnarray}
Inserting the expansion of the potential given in equation~(\ref{eq:pot_exp1}) into 
the momentum space Schr\"odinger equation~(\ref{eq:momspace1}) and projecting 
the equation on the harmoncis $\exp ( i\mu \omega )$, the three-dimensional 
integral equation has been reduced to an infinite set of two-dimensional 
integral equations. The $\mu$'th integral equation is easily solved as
a matrix diagonalization problem with dimension $N_r\times N_\theta $. 
Where $N_r$ is the number of integration points for the radial integral 
and $N_\theta$ is the number of integration points for the angle integral. The
Schr\"odinger equation can be further reduced to a coupled set of one-dimensional
integral equation by projecting on spherical harmonics (see equation~(\ref{eq:part_wave2})). 
The angular momentum projected potential in equation~(\ref{eq:sph2}) then  takes the form, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber
  V_{lm, l'm'}(k,k') = \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{k}} \int \mathrm{d}{\hat{k}'}\: 
  Y_{lm}^*(\hat{k})\left\{ \sum_{\mu = -\infty}^\infty V_{\mu}(\tilde{k}, \tilde{k}') 
  \exp(i \mu \omega)\right\}   Y_{l'm'}(\hat{k}') \\
  = 2\pi \int_0^\pi d\theta \: \sin\theta \int_0^\pi d\theta' \: \sin\theta' 
  \bar{P}_{lm}(\cos\theta) V_{m}(\tilde{k}, \tilde{k}')  \bar{P}_{l'm}(\cos\theta') \:\delta_{m,m'}  
  \label{eq:pot_exp2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $ \bar{P}_{lm}(x)$ are the normalized associated Legendre polynomials, 
\begin{equation}
  \bar{P}_{lm}(x) = \left\{ { 2l + 1 (l-m)! \over 2 (l+m)! }\right\}^{1/2}P_{lm}(x).
\end{equation}
We wish to study the formation of resonances in the deformed Gaussian potential by 
the contour deformation method. 
The 1-dimensional coupled integral equation are then analytically continued
from the physical to the non-physical energy sheet by distorting the integration contour. 
Choosing a suitable inversion symmetric 
contour $L^+$, discussed in the previous section, we end up with the 
analytically continued coupled integral equations for the axially deformed Gaussian potential, 
\begin{equation}
  \left( {\hbar^2 \over 2\mu } k^2 - E_{nlm}\right) \psi_{nlm}(k) =  
  -\sum_{l'} \int_{L^+} dk' {k'}^2 V_{lm, l'm}(k,k') \psi_{nl'm}(k') 
  \label{eq:part_wave3}
\end{equation}
As a case study we consider a Gaussian potential which in the spherically 
symmetric case reproduce the $J^\pi={3/2^{-}_1} $ resonance in $^5$He. 
The  $J^\pi={3/2^{-}_1}$ resonance, to be associated with the single-particle orbit 
$p_{3/2}$, is experimentally 
known to have a width of $\Gamma \approx 0.60$ MeV.
Using the following parameters for the sperically symmetric Gaussian given in 
equation~(\ref{eq:sph1}),
\begin{equation}
  V_0 = -53.5 \mathrm{MeV}, \:\: \alpha_0 = 0.188 \mathrm{fm}^{-2}
\end{equation}
the Gaussian potential supports a bound state for 
the $l^\pi = 0^+$ channel with energy $E = -14.9044  $MeV, 
and a resonance for the $l^\pi = 1^-$ channel with energy 
$E = 0.7268  -0.3096i $MeV. Here the nucleon spin $s=1/2$ is neglected
since the energy levels are degenerate for $ j = l \pm 1/2 $, which 
follows from the spin independence of the Gaussian potential.
Table~\ref{tab:deform1} gives the convergence of the $m^\pi = 0^+$ 
ground state for deformation parameters $ \delta = \pm 0.9$. It is seen that
the deformation $\delta = 0.9$ affects the bound state the most, and 
the ground state becomes much more less bound $ E = -12.1 $MeV, 
for the prolate deformation. 
On the other hand, the oblate deformation $\delta = -0.9$ has little effect
on the ground state energy $E = -14.7$MeV.

This may be understood by considering the monopole term of the potential, 
which is the main component in the multipole expansion in equation~(\ref{eq:multipoles}).
In figure~\ref{fig:monopole} a plot of the monopole part of the Gaussian 
potential with deformation parameters $\delta = \pm 0.9$ is given, together with a plot 
of the spherically symmetric potential. It is
seen that the monopole term for the $\delta = -0.9$ potential is more or less identical 
to the spherically symmetric potential (slightly less attractive), 
on the other hand the monopole 
term for the $\delta = 0.9 $ potential is less attractive for small radii, but
more attractive at large distances.  From this one may conclude that the 
ground state of the $\delta = -0.9$ 
potential will be more bound than for the $\delta = 0.9$ potential, since 
the ground state is deeply bound and the wave function will be
mainly located in the interior part of the potential.

The resonant orbit $l^\pi = 1^-$ in the spherically symmetric 
potential is split into two non-degenerate orbits ( $m^\pi = 0^- $ and $ m^\pi  = 1^-$) 
in the case of an axially symmetric deformation. This is a 
characteristic of axially deformed potentials.
Table~\ref{tab:deform2} gives the convergence of the $m^\pi = 0^-$ and  
$m^\pi = 1^-$ excited negative parity states in the Gaussian potential
for deformation parameters $ \delta = \pm 0.5$. In all cases a satisfactory 
convergence is obtained with $l_{\mathrm{max}} = 5$. For the states 
with angular momentum projection along the $z$-axis ( $ m = 0$ ), it is
seen that for $\delta = 0.5$, ( prolate deformation ), the $ l^\pi = 1^-$ state
has become a bound state with energy $ E = -0.680 $MeV. 
For zero angular momentum projection, the particle moves in an orbit
making $ \theta = 0$ degrees with the $z$-axis. So in the case of a prolate deformation, 
where the field is stretched out along the $z$-axis, a particle moving in this
orbit will ``feel'' the field more strongly than compared with the spherically symmetric 
field, and it will become more bound. This explains also why the particle 
with $m=0$ becomes more unbound in the case of the oblate deformation $\delta = -0.5$,

For the $m=1$ case the opposite
takes place. In the case of $\delta = 0.5$ the particle becomes more unbound, 
while in the of $\delta = -0.5$ the particle becomes more bound. By considering 
the dipole ($l=1$) term of the wave function, the particle moves in 
an orbit making $\theta = \pi/4$ degrees with the $z$-axis. From this
it may be understood that particle gains more binding in the case of 
an oblate deformation $\delta = -0.5$ and becomes more unphysical in the 
opposite case $\delta = 0.5$ 
( see columns 4,5,8 and 9 of table~\ref{tab:deform2}).

In table~\ref{tab:deform3} the squared amplitudes of the wave functions are given
for each partial wave $l$. It is seen that in all cases that the 
squared amplitudes for the $l=1$ component of the total wave function, 
is nearly equal to the norm of the total wave function, while
all other partial wave amplitudes are vanishing. In this sense one may 
say that the orbital angular momentum is approximatetly a ``good'' quantum number.

bound state varies much more strongly for a prolate deformation ($\delta > 0$), than 
for an oblate deformation.

the resonance display a weak variation from the $\delta = 0$ resonance. On the
other hand, as $\delta \rightarrow 0.9 $ the imaginary part of the energy
dives into the lower half complex energy plane, and the resonance
state becomes strongly unphysical.

\section{Two-particle resonances and bound states embedded in the continuum in complex potentials} 
\label{sec:optical}
CDM has a number of different applications, in this section
scattering from a complex Malfliet-Tjon interaction 
describing absorbtive and emitting processes is considered. 
\footnote{See Paper I for a detailed analysis of the 
structure of the Malfliet-Tjon potential in momentum space, the relevant 
equations to be solved and the bound, anti-bound and resonant pole distributions 
as funtion of the interaction strength.}
Complex potentials have commonly been used in optical potential models 
in nuclear and particle physics. Inelastic scattering where the conservation 
of flux is broken due to the possibility of the particle to 
be ejected to other exit channels or particles to emerge from them, may 
be taken into account by a complex absorbing or emitting potentials respectively. 
Another application of complex potentials, is the nucleon-antinucleon scattering,
in which a short range complex annihilation potential may describe how
bound- and resonant states are formed such systems. 

In letting the interaction strengths be generalized to the complex plane 
the Schr\"odinger equation 
becomes a non-hermitian eigenvalue problem from the very beginning, and 
the eigenvalues will in general 
become complex. See Refs.~\cite{kukulin, kok} for a more rigorous 
discussion of complex interactions. Below follows an illustration that 
CDM gives accurate calculation 
of the complete energy spectrum for complex interactions.  
The pole 
trajectories are studied by varying the absorbtive 
and emittive strength of the interaction. 

In the case of the Malfliet-Tjon interaction two cases are studied. 
First the attractive strength, $ V_A  \rightarrow (1+\eta i)V_A $, is scaled 
by a complex constant $ 1 + \eta i$ 
keeping the repulsive strength $V_R$  real. 
Since the attractive strength $V_A$ is a negative quantity, 
absorbtive scattering takes place for $ \eta > 0 $ while
emittive scattering takes place for $ \eta < 0$. 
Secondly  both the attractive and repulsive interaction
strengths are scaled, i.e. $ V  \rightarrow (1+\eta i)V$. 
Starting with $\nu_A = -5 $,
 so for $ \eta = 0 $ a resonance at
$ E = 5.1804 -3.1555i $ MeV corresponding to a pole at $ k = 0.3682 - 0.1033i \: \mathrm{fm}^{-1} $ 
in the complex $k$-plane appears (see Paper I)
\footnote{Here $ V_A = \nu_A\times \hbar c $, see Paper I for more details.}.
In figure~\ref{fig:optical1} a plot of 
the pole trajectory for varying $\eta $ 
is given, keeping $\nu_A$ fixed. An imaginary part is added to the attractive
strength $V_A$ while $V_R$ is kept real. 
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{9cm}{7cm}{\epsfig{file=figures/optical.eps}}
\end{center}
\caption{Pole trajectory of the $l=1$ resonance in the $\nu_A = -5$ Malfliet-Tjon interaction,
for increasing absorbtion/emission. Here only the attractive strength of the interaction
takes complex values,$ V_A  \rightarrow (1+\eta i)V_A$. }
\label{fig:optical1}
\end{figure}
From the figure it is seen that when the probability for finding the particle increases
( $\ eta < 0$ ), the resonance pole approaches the real $k$-axis, and eventually crosses from the 
non-physical to the physical energy sheet. In the case of absorbtion ( $ \eta > 0 $ ) the opposite
effect is observed. That the pole becomes ``more'' physical with a repulsive imaginary part added to 
the potential, may be understood from the following argument. The resonance is formed inside 
the potential barrier, with a limited lifetime before it tunnels through the barrier and dies. 
If more particles are created inside the barrier, the probability of finding a particle inside
the barrier should increase  with the number of particles added. 

In figure~\ref{fig:optical2} a plot of the pole trajectory 
of the resonance at $ E = 5.1804 -3.1555i $ with $\eta = 0$ is given for varying $\eta $.
Here both attractive and repulsive part are scaled. 
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{9cm}{7cm}{\epsfig{file=figures/optical2.eps}}
\end{center}
\caption{Pole trajectory of the $l=1$ resonance in the $\nu_A = -5$ Malfliet-Tjon interaction,
for increasing absorbtion/emission. Here both attractive and repulsive strengths of the interaction
takes complex values,$ V  \rightarrow (1+\eta i)V$ .}
\label{fig:optical2}
\end{figure}
In scaling both the attractive and repulsive parts of the potential with the 
same complex constant $ 1 + \eta i $, both absorbtion and emission takes place.
However, since the potential is on average more attractive than repulsive, the 
total effect of letting $ \eta $ become negative will be emission of particles
while letting $ \eta  $ become positive will result in absorbtion of particles. This is 
also seen from the figure~\ref{fig:optical2}, where the pole moves towards the
physical sheet for $ \eta < 0$, and becomes more ``unphysical'' for $ \eta > 0$.  
Since absorbtion and emission are competing processes in this case, the dependence
of the pole position on increasing/decreasing imaginary part of 
the potential should be weaker than in the 
former case where only the attractive part was scaled, i.e.  pure 
absorbtion and emission took place. 
This is observed from figures.~\ref{fig:optical1},\ref{fig:optical2}. In figure~\ref{fig:optical1}
the pole has moved onto the physical energy sheet for $ \eta = - 0.1 $ while
it is still on the nonphysical sheet in figure~\ref{fig:optical2}. The same strong and weak 
dependence on $\eta $ is observed for the absorbtive process $ \eta = 0.1 $.   

For comparison with the results for the Malfliet-Tjon potential above, 
the pole trajectory for  the $l=1$ 
Yamaguchi interaction with $\beta = 2 \:\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$ and 
interaction strength $ \lambda = 165 \:\mathrm{MeVfm}^{-1} $ is considered as well
\footnote{See Paper I for details on the $l=1$ Yamaguchi potential}. 
This interaction supports a resonance at $ E = 0.8736 -0.1285i $ MeV 
for $\eta = 0 $. Figure~\ref{fig:optical3} gives a plot of the pole trajectory 
of the resonance for varying $\eta $. 
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{9cm}{7cm}{\epsfig{file=figures/optical3.eps}}
\end{center}
\caption{Pole trajectory of the resonance at 
 $ E = 0.8736 -0.1285i $ MeV  in the Yamaguchi interaction with 
$\beta = 2 \:\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$ and 
 interaction strength $ \lambda = 165 \:\mathrm{MeVfm}^{-1} $ }
\label{fig:optical3}
\end{figure}
From the figure it is seen that pole behaves in the same way with increasing 
emission  and  absorbtion as in the Malfliet-Tjon case considered in figures~\ref{fig:optical1} and 
\ref{fig:optical2}.

From the  above numerical analysis of the resonance pole trajectory for 
a complex absorbing or emitting potential, one may make the following conclusion.
For increasing emission, i.e. $ \eta < 0 $,  the resonant pole 
in the third quadrant of the complex $k$-plane
moves towards the real $k$-axis.
Eventually the resonant poles move
through the unitarity cut and 
onto the physical energy sheet (upper half complex $k$-plane). 
When the pole crosses the cut, the imaginary part of the resonance energy is 
zero, that is why poles located on the cut are usually defined as 
\emph{bound states embedded in the continuum}. 
Poles which are located on the physical energy sheet 
may be interpreted as unstable bound states. 
Poles moving onto the physical energy sheet may therefore give a clear 
signature in physical observables such as phaseshifts and scattering cross sections.
For increasing absorbtion on the other hand, i.e. $\eta > 0$ , the resonant pole 
becomes more and more unphysical in the sense that it moves away from the
physical scattering axis. These conclusion apply in all cases considered above,
and one may expect these conclusions to hold for other potential shapes. 

The illustrations above indicates a general behaviour of decay resonant states 
when the interaction is scaled by a complex constant. One may ask in a similar fashion 
in what way the capture resonant states develops as a function of $\eta$. Will the symmetry 
with respect to the imaginary $k$-axis for capture and decay states prevail ? 	
The answer to this is no. It can be seen by considering the symmetry properties of the 
scattering matrix in the case of a complex interaction. In particular we have the 
property, see equations~(\ref{eq:sym1},\ref{eq:sym2}) 
\begin{equation}
S_l^*(-k^*,\eta^*)  = S_l(k,\eta) 
\end{equation}
This implies that if the interaction $ (1+i\eta )V$ supports a 
resonance at $k$, the complex conjugated interaction $ (1+i\eta)^*V$ supports a resonance at
$ -k^*$. The number of poles is invariant with respect to $\eta $, the poles
only get redistributed as $\eta$ is varied. The symmetry between decay and capture states
is therefore broken. As the capture resonance moves away from the real $k$-axis in the third
quadrant of the complex $k$-plane the capture state moves toward the real $k$-axis and 
eventually into the physical energy sheet. It is quite interesting that a capture state
which for $\eta = 0 $ was considered a non-physical state, may become a physical bound state
with a finite lifetime for $\eta > 0$.

\begin{center}
\resizebox{9cm}{7cm}{\epsfig{file=figures/mt_phase_opt.eps}}
\end{center}
\caption{Real part of phase shifts for the $l=1$ Malfliet-Tjon interaction with

\label{fig:mt_phase_opt2}
\end{figure}


In the case of complex interactions the phase shift is a complex quantity, $\delta = \delta_R + i \delta_I$, 
the real part $\delta_R$ is interpreted as before and describes the elastic scattering while
the imaginary part, $\delta_I $,  is a measure of the inelastic scattering taking place. 
Figures~\ref{fig:mt_phase_opt},\ref{fig:mt_phase_opt2} 
gives a plot of the real and imaginary part of the phase shifts for  
the $l=1$ Malfliet-Tjon interaction with
$ \nu _A = -5$ and $\eta = 0, \pm 0.2 $. Here only the attractive strength $V_A$ 
was scaled, keeping the
repulsive part $V_R$
real, see figure~\ref{fig:optical1} for details on the pole trajectory.
In the case $ \eta = -0.2 $ the decay state
has moved onto the physical energy sheet and become a bound state. In the case 
$ \eta = 0.2 $ the capture state has moved into the physical energy sheet and become a bound state, 
while the decay state has become more unphysical.
There is no way to differentiate between the real part of the phase shifts for $\eta = \pm 0.2 $.
The elastic scattering is the same for both cases, which is expected since the real part of the
interaction is the same. The imaginary part of the phase shifts are on the other hand different, and
is directly related to the sign of $\eta $ where either an absorbtion of particles out of
the elastic channel or an emission of particles into the elastic channel takes place. 

A generalized Levinson theorem may be formulated for the real part of the phase shift \cite{kukulin}, 
$\delta_R(0) -\delta_R (\infty ) = n\pi $ 
where $n $ is the number of poles in the upper half complex $k$-plane (physical energy sheet). 
In figure.~\ref{fig:mt_phase_opt}
we have for $\eta = \pm 0.2 $ , $\delta (0) = \pi $ which is in accordance with the generalized
Levinson' theorem.

\section{Two-particle scattering; isolating resonance phenomena by CDM}
In this section we will discuss the solution for the full
off-shell $t$-matrix, and hence the full two-body scattering problem, by expanding 
the two-body Green's function in a complete set of Berggren states. 
The Berggren representation of the scattering equations gives 
an analytic continuation in energy, from the upper rim of
cut through the cut and into the non-physical energy sheet.     

The $t$-matrix is defined in operator form by 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:t1}
t(\omega)  = V + Vg^{II}(\omega)V,
\end{equation}
or 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:t2}
t(\omega) =  V + Vg_0^{II}(\omega)t(\omega).
\end{equation} 
Here $\omega$ is the incoming energy, $ g^{II}(\omega) $ is the resolvent, 
commonly known as the Green's operator, and $g_0^{II}(\omega) $ the 
corresponding free Green's operator. In operator form they are defined by
\begin{eqnarray}
  g_0^{II}(\omega) & = & {1\over \omega - H_{0}}, \\ 
  \label{eq:greensfunc}
  g^{II}(\omega) & = & {1\over \omega - H }. 
\end{eqnarray}
They are related through the Dyson equation
\begin{equation}
  g^{II}(\omega) = g_0^{II}(\omega) + g_0^{II}(\omega)Vg^{II}(\omega)
\end{equation} 
The term $H_{0}$ is the kinetic energy operator and $H$ the full two-body
Hamiltonian. The physical interpretation of the Green's functions is that $g_0^{II} $ 
describes the propagation of two noninteracting particles, and $g^{II}$ 
describes the propagation of two interacting particles in free space.

\subsection{Berggren representation of the $t$-matrix}
The Berggren representation of the Green's function is obtained by expanding the unit 
operator using the completeness relation given in equation~(\ref{eq:unity2}). In this case 
the Green's operator takes the form
\begin{equation} 
 \label{eq:spectral2}
g^{II}(\omega) = \sum _{n = a,b,c,d} {\vert\psi _{n}\rangle\langle \psi^* _{n}\vert\over 
\omega - E_{n}} + \int _{L^+} dE{\vert\psi\rangle
\langle\psi^*\vert\over \omega - E}.
\end{equation}	
Here $n$ denotes bound, antibound and resonant states. The integration contour $L^{+}$
denotes an arbitrary inversion symmetric contour, see e.g. figure~\ref{fig:int_contour2}  in 
SubSec.~\ref{sec:berggren} of Chapter~\ref{chap:gentheory}, 
and gives the non-resonant distorted continuum contribution to   
the interacting Green's function. If we neglect the non-resonant continuum contribution 
to the Green's function we get the \emph{resonant state expansion} of the Green's  
function. Such expansions have been studied over the last decade for finite range potentials, 
see e.g. \cite{vertse, vertse1, lind}. The Green's function given in equation~(\ref{eq:spectral2})     
is continuous and analytic in energy across the real axis and into the domain ${\bf C} $ of 
the lower part of the complex energy plane. Equation ~(\ref{eq:spectral2}) is therefore an analytic 
continuation in energy of the Green's function defined along the real energy axis. 

The Berggren representation of the $t$-matrix is obtained by inserting the 
interacting Green's function given by equation~(\ref{eq:spectral2}) into equation~(\ref{eq:t1}), giving
\begin{equation}
t(\omega) = V + \Delta t(\omega) = V + \Delta t^{R}(\omega ) + \Delta t^{C}(\omega).
\end{equation}
Here $\Delta t^{R}(\omega )$ is the resonant contribution while
$ \Delta t^{C}(\omega) $ is the non-resonant distorted continuum contribution to 
the $t$-matrix.
By projecting $t(\omega)$ on momentum states, and decomposing
into partial waves, the  $t$-matrix elements $t_{l}(k,k';\omega) $ can be 
expressed as 1-dimensional integral equations,
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
t_{l}(k,k',\omega) = V_{l}(k,k')  
\label{eq:tmat2}
 + \int _{L^{+}}\int _{L^{+}} dq\:d{q'}
\: q^{2}{q'}^{2}
V _{l}(k,q)g^{II}(q,q';\omega)V_{l}(q',k'), 
\label{eq:tmat1}
\end{equation}
This representation of the $t$-matrix is valid as long as we do not pass
through any singularities of the interaction potential by deforming the real 
$k$-axis into the distorted contour $L^{+}$. 

In numerically solving for equation~(\ref{eq:tmat1}), the eigenvalue 
problem on the discretized contour $L^+$ given in equation~(\ref{eq:momentum_space3}) has to be solved.
Then the interacting Green's function is represented in the discretized 
complete set of momentum states given in equation~(\ref{eq:unity2}), giving the discretized
Green's function, 
\begin{equation}
  g^{II}(k_i,k_j, \omega) = \sum _{n}{\psi_{nl}(k_i)\psi_{n l}(k_j)\over  \omega - E_{nl}} = 
  \sum _{n}\left( \sqrt{w_iw_j}k_ik_j\right)^{-1}{\psi_{nl}(i)\psi_{n l}(j)\over  \omega - E_{nl}}.
\end{equation}
Inserting this discretized form of the interacting Green's function into 
equation~(\ref{eq:tmat1}) and discretizing the integration over $q$ and $q'$, 
a discretized version of the $t$-matrix is obtained. Having obtained $g^{II}(k_i,k_j) $, 
the full off-shell $t$-matrix is therefore obtained by the matrix equation
\begin{equation}
  t_l(k_i,k_j,\omega) = V_l(k_i,k_j) + \tilde{V}_l^T(i) \tilde{g}^{II}(\omega ) \tilde{V}_l(j) 
\end{equation} 
where $\tilde{V}_l(n)$ is the $n$'th column of the potential matrix $V_l(k_i,k_j)$ 
and $\tilde{g}^{II}(\omega)$is the matrix
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{g}^{II}(i,j,\omega) = \sqrt{w_i w_j}k_ik_j 
  \sum _{n}{\psi_{nl}(i)\psi_{n l}(j)\over  \omega - E_{nl}}.
\end{equation}
Applying CDM enables us to 
obtain $t_{l}(k,k';\omega) $ for both real and complex energies $\omega $. 
The integral becomes non-singular on the deformed contour for real and positive 
input energies $\omega $, resulting in numerically stable solutions for physical
two-body scattering. Equation~(\ref{eq:tmat1}) can also be considered as an
analytic continuation of equation~(\ref{eq:tmat1}) for complex input energies $\omega$,
and stable numerical solutions can be obtained for complex energies above the 
distorted contour. The Berggren representation of the $t$-matrix also allows for a
separate study of the resonant and continuum contributions.   
The limitation of this method is due to that most  potentials
in momentum space have singularities in the complex plane when one argument 
is real and the other is complex.
By applying contour $L_{1}^{+}$, which is based
on rotation into the complex plane, in most cases there will be restrictions
on both rotation angle ($\theta$) and maximum  incoming and outgoing momentum 
($k,k'$), see for example Ref.~\cite{nuttal}. 

Using contour $L_{2}^{+} $ we can avoid these limitations by 
choosing the integration contour in such a way that the potential 
singularities always will lie outside the integration contour, and therefore
do not give any restriction on rotation angle and maximum incoming and outgoing
momentum.

\subsection{Fredholm representation}
The partial wave decomposition of equation~(\ref{eq:t2}) gives the \emph{Fredholm} 
representation, commonly known as the Lippmann-Schwinger equation  
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tmat3}
t_{l}(k,k';\omega) = V_{l}(k,k')+
{2\over \pi}\int _{0}^{\infty } {dq q^{2}V_{l}(k,q)t_{l}(q,k')\over \omega - E(q) }.
\end{equation}
In physical two-body scattering the input energy is real and positive. In this
case the \emph{Fredholm} integral equation~(\ref{eq:tmat3}) has a singular
kernel of Cauchy type. Solving singular integrals can be done 
by Cauchy's Residue theorem, where we 
integrate over a closed contour enclosing the poles. There are two ways of
doing this, either by letting $ z $ lie an infinitesimal distance above the 
real axis, i.e., $ \omega \rightarrow z + i\epsilon $,  or by letting $ \omega $
lie on the real axis. In both cases we must choose a suitable contour enclosing the
 singularity. If we choose the latter position of the singularity,  we get  
 a  Cauchy \emph{principal-value} integral where we integrate up to - but not
 through - the singularity, and a second contour integral,  where the 
contour can be chosen as a semicircle around the singularity. 
Equation~(\ref{eq:tmat3}) can thus be given in terms of a principal value part and a 
second term coming from integration over the semicircle around the pole. The result is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pv1}
 t_{l}(k,k';\omega)  = V_{l}(k,k') + {2\over \pi}
\mathcal{P}\int _{0}^{\infty } {dq q^{2}V _{l}(k,q)t_{l}(q,k')\over \omega - E (q) } 
 \:- \: 2i\mu k_{0}V_{l}(k,k_{0})t_{l}(k_{0},k';\omega).
\end{equation}
By rewriting the principal value integral using the relation
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}\int_{0}^{\infty}dk\: {f(k)\over k_{0}^{2} - k^{2}} =  
\int_{0}^{\infty}dk\: {[f(k)-f(k_{0})]\over k_{0}^{2} - k^{2}}, 
\end{equation}
we obtain an equation suitable for numerical evaluation.
Equation~(\ref{eq:pv1}) can be converted into a set of linear 
equations by approximating the integral by a sum over $N$ 
Gaussian quadrature points $( k_{j}; j = 1,...N  ) $, each weighted by $ w_{j} $ 
The full off-shell $t$-matrix is then obtained by matrix inversion. This
method for solving integral equations is known as the Nystrom method. 
It is numerically effective and stable, except for the rare case when
 the incoming energy $\omega$ coincides with or is very close to one of the 
integration points. 

So far we have only considered physical input energies in 
equation~(\ref{eq:tmat3}), but it has been shown in Ref.~\cite{kukulin} 
that the analytically 
continued Lippmann-Schwinger equation to complex energies takes the same form
as equation~(\ref{eq:pv1}). By solving the full off-shell $t$-matrix for arbitrary 
complex input energy, we do not have to alter the set of linear equations
obtained for physical energy, the only modification is that the energy is
complex. 

The Lippmann-Schwinger equation  for $t$-matrix (\ref{eq:tmat3}), 
can be solved by the contour deformation method as well. Using CDM the integral equation
given in equation~(\ref{eq:tmat3}) has a compact integral
kernel (Schmidt kernel) 
for positive incoming energies $\omega$, 
thus the principal value (PV) prescription may be avoided. 
In the first step we calculate the $t$-matrix elements $t_l(z,k,\omega)$ 
where $k$ is on the real axis and $z$ is on a suitable deformed contour $L^+$.
This is obtained by solving the integral equation, 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tmat4}
  t_{l}(z,k;\omega) = V_{l}(z,k)+
  \int_{L^+} {dz' {z'}^{2}V_{l}(z,z')t_{l}(z',k)\over \omega - E(z') }.
\end{equation}
Here it is seen that for real input energies $\omega $ 
the integral kernel is non-singular sincel the kinetic energy term $E(z)$ is
defined on a deformed contour in the complex $k$-plane. Having obtained 
$t_l(z,k;\omega) $ the $t$-matrix elements $t_l(k,k';\omega) $ is 
straightforward obtainable by the non-singular integral, 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tmat5}
  t_{l}(k,k';\omega) = V_{l}(k,k')+
  \int_{L^+} {dz {z}^{2}V_{l}(k,z)t_{l}(z,k')\over \omega - E(z) }.
\end{equation}
here $k$ and $k'$ are given along the real $k$-axis, while $z$ 
is 
defined along the deformed integration contour $L^+$.
This two-step procedure using CDM offers an alternative approach to the numerical
solutions for the $t$-matrix. Stable solutions will be obtainable as long 
as the contour does not pass through any singularities of the potential.
Below we consider the solution of the $t$-matrix for the Malfliet-Tjon potential 
by CDM and compare results with the standard principal value (PV) prescription.
First of all, we have to determine the singularity structure of the potential 
Malfliet-Tjon potential. From equations~(\ref{eq:tmat4},\ref{eq:tmat2}) it is seen that the potential 
must be defined for one real variable $k$ and 
one complex variable $z$ given on the contour $L^+$. 
So in conclusion, the contour $L^+$ must be chosen in such a way that the 
potential admit analytical continuation from the real $k$-axis to the 
complex contour $L^+$. 

For an illustration we  consider two contours $C_1$ and $C_2$.
The $C_1$ contour is just the phase transformation, or complex rotation, 
$ C_1 \: : \:\: \vert k \vert exp(-i\theta) $. The $C_2$ contour consits of a combination of 
a rotation and a translation in the complex $k$-plane\footnote{See Paper I for further details. 
In this particular study
natural units are used, i.e. the momentum $k$ is in units of MeV and the potential 
is in units of MeV$^{-2}$. In Paper I conventional units were used.}.  
If we integrate along contour $C_{1} $ there will always be a singularity on the 
contour given by 
\begin{equation}
z = k_{\mathrm{max}} - i\mu,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
k_{\mathrm{max}} = \mu /\tan(\theta ),
\end{equation}
and $\mu = \mathrm{min}[\mu_{A},\mu_{B}] $\footnote{$\mu $ is here considered as the mass  
of the pions entering the Yukawa potentials; $V(r) = V_0exp(-\mu r)/r$}. 
For $k,k' > k_{\mathrm{max}} $ the contour $C_{1}$ will 
pass through the singularity of the interaction. 
However, if the interaction, $V_{l}(k,k') $, is approximately zero for $k,k' > k_{\mathrm{max}} $,
or the $t$-matrix is wanted only in the low momentum regime ($ k,k' \ll  k_{\mathrm{max}} $),
integrating along contour $C_{1} $ can be done as long as 
\begin{equation}
\theta < \arctan \left( \mu/ k_{\mathrm{max}} \right ).
\end{equation}
In this sense we may call $k_{\mathrm{max}} $ the cutoff momentum. 
This choice may cause numerical unstable solutions for small values of momenta, 
since the rotated contour may lie very close to the real $k$-axis where the
integral kernel is singular.  
The same conclusion has already been pointed out by Nuttal in Ref.~\cite{nuttal2}.

Here we see the advantage of integrating along contour $C_{2}$. Not only 
will it be able to reproduce virtual states (see Paper I), but it yields also
accurate results for  the $t$-matrix for real incoming and outgoing momenta.
It will always  be possible to choose a contour $C_{2}$ lying above the nearest singularity $z = \Re[k] - 
i\mu $, implying no restriction on rotation angle $\theta $ irrespective of cutoff 
momentum $k_{\mathrm{max}} $. Figure~\ref{fig:newfig8} gives an illustration. 
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{9cm}{7cm}{\epsfig{file=figures/newfig9.eps}}
\end{center}
\caption{Illustration of potential singularities for the Malfliet-Tjon interaction $V_{l}(k,z)$, 
where $k$ is real  and $z$ complex. Restriction on the integration contours $C_{1} $ 
and $C_{2}$
is clearly seen for given cutoff momentum $k_{max } $ ($V_{l}(k,k') \approx 0 $ for 
$k,k' > k_{\mathrm{max}} $). }
\label{fig:newfig8}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:newfig9} shows a plot of the calculated $t$-matrix elements
$t_{l}(k,k;E) $ for incoming energy $E = 100$ MeV for the $s$ -wave Malfliet-Tjon
interaction, using the contours $C_{1} $ and $C_{2}$. In this case we used a 
rotation angle $\theta = \pi/6 $ for both contours, and a translation $b = 
300$ MeV for contour $C_{2}$. The Malfliet-Tjon interaction has a 
singularity along contour $C_{1}$, given by $k_{\mathrm{max}} = \mu /\tan(\theta ) = 
529.77$ MeV. In this case the interaction 
is not sufficiently neglible for $k,k' > k_{\mathrm{max}}$,
and using contour $C_{1}$ will not give accurate calculation of the $t$-matrix. 
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{9cm}{7cm}{\epsfig{file=figures/newfig10.eps}}

\caption{Plot of $t$-matrix elements for the $s$-wave Malfliet-Tjon interaction

The potential singularity along contour $C_{1}$ is clearly displayed, and
located at $k_{\mathrm{max}} = 529.77$ MeV.}
\label{fig:newfig9}
\end{figure}
This illustrates clearly the advantage of integrating along the contour $C_{2}$
instead of $C_{1}$, and the importance of choosing a contour which avoids
singularities in the potential. 

For a comparison of CDM with the standard PV prescription in
solving for the $t$-matrix numerically we consider the 
the on-shell unitarity for the $S$-matrix calculated with both methods. 
Table~\ref{tab:tab7} reports
calculations done by the principal value prescription and the
contour deformation method $C_{2}$. The calculations used $N=50 $ 
integration points for the principal value
integration, for the contour deformation method we used $30$ points
along the rotated line and $N_T = 
100,200$ along the translated line.  
We observe that we need a higher number of integration points
along the translated line of $C_{2}$ in order to obtain a comparable accuracy with
the PV method.

\section{Application of CDM to resonance-like phenomena in nuclear matter;
  pair instabilities and the onset of pairing}
\subsection{2p2h spectral structures in a nuclear medium.} 
\label{sec:inmedium}
In this section we discuss the application of CDM to nucleon-nucleon scattering
in infininte nuclear matter. Of particular interest is the formation and decay of
two nucleon bound- and resonant states in nuclear matter. In the early 70's 
Bishop \emph{et. al.} ~\cite{bishop1,bishop2} showed that the existence of bound state
pairs in a nuclear medium can be directly linked to the singularities of the 
in-medium t-matrix. 
The existence of bound pair states in nuclear medium, 
is closely related to the concept of \emph{cooper} pairs. Cooper pairs are
considered as the formation of bound electron pairs in a degenerate electron gas,  
giving rise the phenomenon of \emph{super conductivity}.
Treating holes on equal footing with particles  Bishop \emph{et. al.} 
showed that the pairing effects in nuclear matter 
where increased when comparing with
the standard Bethe-Goldstone approach where only particle propagation 
is considered, see e.g. Ref.~\cite{haftel}. 
In Ref.~\cite{goldberg} showed that the BCS gap equation is directly related 
to the 2p2h bound pair states. Two decades later Dickhoff \emph{et. al.} \cite{dick1,dick2,dick3}
discussed similar properties of composite pair states in nuclear matter,
and formally related the BCS gap equation to the
2p2h self-consistent eigenvalue equation for the bound states.
There it was suggested that strong pairing effects would be present
in nuclear matter
at certain densities and total momentum, due to the existence of bound pair states.

It is well known that for a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction there may appear 
pairing instabilities in attractive partial waves near the fermi surface. 
For a continuous single particle spectrum pairing instabilty is 
interpreted as an instability to form bound 2p2h states in nuclear matter.  
These pairing instabilities appear as complex poles located around the fermi surface 
in the effective interaction $\Gamma $. In determining the self consistent self energy, 
one should take the complete energy dependence of the effective interaction into account. 
In earlier calculations only the non-resonant continuum portions of the effective interaction
were taken into account. The inclusion of $K = 0$ 2p2h bound states in the 
calculation of the self energy, was discussed in Ref. (). 

For a continuous single particle spectrum these 2p2h bound 
pair states appear as complex  poles of the effective interaction, 
located around the Fermi energy $2e_f$. 
These singularities give rise to serious numerical 
problems when solving the iterated Feynman - Galitskii integral equation for the 
effective interaction. In Ref.~\cite{dick3} it was proposed that an introduction of a gap in 
the single particle spectrum located at the fermi surface would resolve this problem.  
This suggestion was based on the observation that the 2p2h bound state poles 
become real poles by introducing a gap in the single particle spectrum at the fermi surface. 
If there is no gap in the single particle energy spectrum, there
is no room for the bound states to appear as real excitations, since the hole-hole continuum 
extends from $-\infty $ to $ 2e_f$ and the particle-particle continuum extends from 
$2e_f$ to $\infty$. So the $2p$ and $2h$ poles appear at complex conjugate energies, 
$E_{2p} = E_{2h}^*$, around the Fermi energy $2e_f$, this is why the poles of the $t$-matrix
are often called pair-instabilities. By introduction of a mininum gap in the single particle 
spectrum this instability will disappear and the poles will position themselves on the
real energy axis between $2e_f^+ $ and $ 2e_f^-$.
Ultimately this gap at the fermi surface would be generated self consistently. 

The 2p2h bound states are dependent on both the fermi momentum $k_f$ and the total momentum 
between the nucleons $K$. 
The 2p2h bound states appear only in a specific density 
region where strong pair correlations are expected, and will eventually dissolve with increasing
center of momentum (total momentum) between the nucleons. 
In this case the complete energy spectrum is exposed without analytic continuation of the eigenvalue 
problem into the complex $k$-plane. However, 
with increasing $K_{CM}$ the 2p2h poles will move towards  
2p2h continuum, and one may expect that the 2p2h poles will move into the lower half 
$k$-plane (non-physical energy sheet) 
for a center of momentum $K$ greater that some critical value $K_{max}$. 
In close analogy with the free scattering case, these poles may be associated with 
either virtual or resonant states. In this case CDM may prove to be a 
reliable and efficient way to calculate these exotic 2p2h states. 
These 2p2h poles will also appear as singularities in the effective interaction, and may
on the same level as the bound state poles cause numerical trouble. 
One may expect that an introduction of a gap at the fermi surface will 
not make these complex poles real poles, since they are located on the non-physical energy sheet.
From this observation one may conclude that
an introduction of a gap at the fermi surface does not completely solve the problem 
associated with pairing instabilities in the iterated effective interaction $\Gamma $. 

We start by outlining the formalism for 2p2h  
bound and scattering problems in infinite nuclear matter, and 
emphasize the relation  between the $t$-matrix and the
two-nucleon eigenvalue equation in nuclear matter.
Holes and particles are treated on equal footing, 
hence allowing for hole-hole and particle-particle propagation. 
Solving for the effective interaction, $\Gamma $,
the particle - particle and hole - hole ladder diagrams are summed to infinite order.
The influence of the surrounding medium is reflected in the Pauli operator and 
self energy insertions. The two nucleon system is translational invariant, and 
center of mass motion can be neglected. The ladder summed effective interaction, $\Gamma (\omega )$, 
is given in operator form 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma (\omega ) = V + Vg_{II}^{(0)}(\omega )\Gamma(\omega)
\label{eq:effective1}
\end{equation}

here $V$ is the nucleon-nucleon interaction and $g_{II}^{(0)}(\omega) $ is the 
non-interacting 2p2h propagator given in terms of a product of two 
single particle propagators. The effective interaction can also be given in terms 
of an interacting 2p2h propagator $g_{II}$, 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma (\omega ) = V + Vg_{II}(\omega)V 
\label{eq:eff2} 
\end{equation}  
$g_{II}(\omega ) $ satisfies the Dyson equation 
\begin{equation}  
g_{II}(\omega ) = g_{II}^{(0)} (\omega ) + g_{II}^{(0)}(\omega)Vg_{II}(\omega )
\label{eq:eff3}
\end{equation}
From equation~(\ref{eq:eff2}) it is seen that the singularity structure of the effective 
interaction $\Gamma (\omega )$ is given in terms of the singularties of the 
interacting 2p2h propagator $g_{II}(\omega ) $.  
By rewriting equation~(\ref{eq:eff3}) as 
\begin{equation}
g_{II}(\omega ) = { g_{II}^{(0)} (\omega )\over 1 - g_{II}^{(0)}(\omega)V} 
\end{equation}
it is seen that finding the poles of $\Gamma (\omega ) $ corresponds 
to solving the characteristic equation 
\begin{equation} 
  \mathrm{det} \left( 1 - g_{II}^{(0)}(\omega)V \right) = 0
\end{equation}
which is associated with the eigenvalue problem
\begin{equation}
(1 - g_{II}^{(0)}(\omega)V)\vert \Psi \rangle = 0 
\label{eq:eigenvalue1}
\end{equation}	 

In the following discussion the propagation of particles 
and holes are considered with respect to an ucorrelated fermi sea, which gives the mean field
approximation to the 2p2h propagators. In this picture the propagator $g_{II}^{(0)}$ 
is known as the Feynman - Galitskii \cite{bishop1} propagator, which in turn gives the Feynman - Galitskii 
integral equation for the effective interaction $\Gamma (\omega )$. 
In the lab system the Feynman - Galitskii propagator is given by
\begin{equation}
g_{II}^{FG(0)}(p_1, p_2, \omega) = { Q( p_{1},p_{2})\over \omega - \epsilon(p_{1}) - \epsilon(p_{2}) } 
\end{equation} 
here $Q = Q_{2p} - Q_{2h} $ 
, the Pauli operator projecting onto the 2p space is given  
\begin{equation}
 Q_{2p}(p_{1},p_{2}) =  \theta( \vert {\bf p}_{1} \vert - k_{f})\theta( \vert {\bf p}_{2} \vert - k_{f})
\end{equation}
and the corresponding 2h projector 
\begin{equation} 
Q_{2h}(p_{1},p_{2}) =   \theta( k_{f} - \vert {\bf p}_{1} \vert)\theta( k_{f} - \vert {\bf p}_{2} \vert)
\end{equation}
the Pauli operator is an implicit function of the fermi momentum $k_f$ defining the 
density of the infinite fermi sea. The eigenvalue equation (\ref{eq:eigenvalue1}) can now be written 
\begin{equation}
\left[ H_{0} + \left(\begin{array}{cc}
Q_{2p} & 0 \\
0 & -Q_{2h} \end{array}\right)V \right] \left(\begin{array}{c} \psi_{2p} \\
\psi_{2h} \end{array}\right) = E \left(\begin{array}{c} \psi_{2p} \\
\psi_{2h} \end{array}\right)    
\label{eq:eigenvalue2}
\end{equation}
\\
here $H_{0}(p_1,p_2) = \epsilon(p_1) + \epsilon(p_2) $.  The single particle energies 
$\epsilon $ are given by a kinetic energy term and a one body energy dependent self energy term,
\begin{equation}
\epsilon(p) = {p^2\over 2M} + \Sigma(p, \epsilon(p) )
\end{equation}
this gives a self consistent equation for the self energy ($\Sigma $). 

The normalization and completeness relation for the 2p2h states are given  
\begin{equation}
\langle \psi_n\vert \phi_{n'}\rangle = \delta _{n,n'}, \:\: 
{\bf 1} = \sum_{n} \vert\psi_{n} \rangle\langle \phi_{n}\vert. 
\end{equation}
Here the dual states $\phi_{nl} $ have been introduced. They are solutions of the transposed 
eigenvalue equation given in equation~(\ref{eq:eigenvalue2}),
and $\phi_{nl}$ and $\psi_{nl}$ constitutes a biorthogonal set of states.
The discrete sum is over bound states and in addition the sum 
implies an integration over the 2p2h continuum. 
Inserting this complete set of 2p2h states into the Feynman - Galitskii 
propagator equation~(\ref{eq:eff3}) the spectral representation of the
2p2h interacting propagator is obtained, 
\begin{equation} 
g_{II}^{FG}(\omega) =  { \sum_{n} \vert\psi_{n} \rangle\langle \psi_{n}\vert \over 
\omega - E_n }
\label{eq:int_prop}
\end{equation} 

As the nucleon-nucleon interaction is given in relative coordinates it is 
convienient to transform from the nucleon lab system to 
relative and center of mass coordinates of the two nucleons, 
\begin{equation}
{\bf k} =  { ( { \bf p_{1}} - { \bf p_{2}} )\over 2 }, \;\; 
{\bf K} =  { ( { \bf p_{1}} + { \bf p_{2}} )\over 2 }
\end{equation} 
Here ${\bf k}$ is the relative momentum and ${\bf K}$ the center of momentum between the two 
interacting nucleons.
To allow a partial wave decomposition  the standard angle 
averaged Pauli operator $ \bar{Q} $ and the angled averaged 
one body operator $\bar{H}_0$ are introduced.

A partial wave decomposition of the 2p2h eigenvalue equation ( \ref{eq:eigenvalue2} ) in relative and 
center of momentum can then be approximated by 
\begin{equation} 
\bar{H}_{0}(k,K) \psi_{nl}^{\alpha} (k,K ) + \bar{Q}(k,K;k_{f}) \int_{0}^{\infty} 
dk' {k'}^{2}V_{l}(k,k')\psi_{nl}^{\alpha}(k',K) = E_{nl}^{\alpha}\psi_{nl}^{\alpha}(k,K)
\label{eq:eigenvalue3}
\end{equation}
Here $\alpha $ represents the conserved quantum numbers $J,S,T$ and 
$k_{f}$ is the fermi momentum. 
The normalization integral for the two 2p2h states is
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{\infty} dk\: k^{2}\psi_{n'l}^{*}(k,K)\phi_{nl}(k,K) 
= \delta_{n,n'}
\end{equation}
where the dual 2p2h states $\phi_{nl}(k,K) $ are given in terms of $\psi_{nl}(k,K)$,
\begin{equation}
\phi_{nl}(k,K) =  \bar{Q}^{-1}(k,K;k_{f})\psi_{nl}(k,K)
\end{equation}
The operator $\bar{H}_{0}$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
\bar{H}_{0} =  {k^{2}\over 2\mu} +{ K^{2}\over 2\mu } + \bar{\Sigma}_1 + \bar{\Sigma}_2,
\end{equation} 
The angle averaged Pauli operator,$\bar{Q} = \bar{Q}_{2p} - \bar{Q}_{2h} $,  entering
 equation~(\ref{eq:eigenvalue3}) will in this case depend on both fermi momentum, $k_{f}$,
 and the center of momentum $K$.  The hole-hole  
part, $\bar{Q}_{2h}$ for $K < k_{f} $ is, see Ref.~\cite{ramos},  
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{Q}_{2h}(k,K;k_{f}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
1 &   0 < k \leq k_{a} \\
{ k_{f}^{2} - K^{2} -k^{2}\over 2kK} & 	 k_{a} < k \leq \sqrt{k_{f}^{2} - K^{2}} \\
0 & 	\textrm{otherwise}
\label{eq:pauli1}
\end{array}\right. 
\end{eqnarray}	
and the particle - particle part, ${\bar Q}_{2p}$, for $K  < k_{f} $ is
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{Q}_{2p}(k,K;k_{f}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
0 &  0 < k  \leq \sqrt{k_{f}^{2} - K^{2}} \\
{ k^{2} + K^{2} - k_{f}^{2}\over 2kK} &  \sqrt{k_{f}^{2} - K^{2}} < k \leq k_{b} \\
1 & 	\textrm{otherwise}
\end{array}\right. 
\label{eq:pauli2}
\end{eqnarray}	
here
\begin{equation}
k_{a} =  k_{f} - K, \:\: k_{b} = K + k_{f}
\end{equation}
In the case $K > k_{f} $, $ \bar{Q}_{2h}$ is zero everywhere. The particle - particle 
part, ${\bar Q}_{2p} $, is given 
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{Q}_{2p}(k,K;k_{f}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
1 &  0 < k  \leq k_{a}  \\
{ k^{2} + K^{2} - k_{f}^{2}\over 2kK} &   k_{a} < k \leq k_{b} \\
1 & 	\textrm{otherwise}
\end{array}\right. 
\label{eq:pauli3}
\end{eqnarray}	
here 
\begin{equation}
k_{a} = K -k_{f} , \:\: k_{b} = K + k_{f}.
\end{equation}

Equation~(\ref{eq:eigenvalue3}) represents a non-hermitian eigenvalue problem. The general 2p2h energy 
spectrum will therefore in general be complex. The energy spectrum will depend on both the 
single particle energies entering the unpertubed one-body operator $\bar{H}_{0} $ and the
two nucleon interaction $V_{l}(k,k')$. For a continuous single particle spectrum the 
2h continuum extends from $-\infty $ to the fermi energy $ E_{f} = k_{f}^{2}/2\mathrm{m}_{n} $ and the
2p continuum extends from $E_{f}$ to $ \infty $. 
The analytic structure of the integral kernel is the same as for free scattering except for 
the angle averaged Pauli operator.  If we want to search for pole structures on the 
non-physical energy sheet, an analytical continuation in energy through the branch cut along 
the real axis, and onto the non-physical energy sheet has to be performed.   
The Pauli operator is continuous along the whole real $k$-axis but presents 
discontinuous derivatives at $k_{a}$ and $k_{b}$. For real $k$ the Pauli operator is therefore
analytic only within the domains $ k \in [0 , k_{a}] $, $ k\in ( k_{a}, k_{b}] $ and
$ k \in  ( k_{b}, \infty ) $. 
Summarizing; the Pauli operator is nonsingular in the complex $k$-plane, and
analytic within three domains given by $ D_{1} =  \vert z \vert \leq k_{a} $, 
$ D_{2} = k_{a} < \vert z \vert \leq k_{b} $  and $ D_{3}  =  \vert z \vert > k_{b} $.
Analytical continuation of equation~(\ref{eq:eigenvalue3}) 
onto the non-physical energy sheet (lower half $k$-plane) can be carried out
within each domain where the integral kernel is analytic. 
Figure~\ref{fig:medium1} gives an illustration 
of regions in the complex plane where the integral kernel is analytic, singularites in the potential
are also shown along with a possible choice of deformed integration contour $C$.

\caption{ $D_{1}$, $D_{2}$ and $ D_{3} $ demarcated by dotted circles 
define the regions in the complex    $ k$ -plane 
where the Pauli operator is analytic. The shaded area represents a region in the 
complex $k$-plane where singularities in the potential appear. The optimal  
deformed contour choice for equation~(\ref{eq:eigenvalue3}) is given by $  C = C_{1} + C_{2} + C_{3} $.}
\label{fig:medium1}
\end{figure}
The transformed equation~(\ref{eq:eigenvalue3}) will on the distorted contour $C$ take the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:transformed} 
\bar{H}_{0}(k,K) \psi_{nl}^{\alpha} (k,K ) + \bar{Q}(k,K;k_{f})\int_{C} 
dk' {k'}^{2}V_{l}(k,k')\psi_{nl}^{\alpha}(k',K) = E_{nl}^{\alpha}\psi_{nl}^{\alpha}(k,K)
\end{equation}
here $k$ and $k'$ are both defined on the contour $C$, giving a closed integral equation. 
The fermi momentum, $k_{f}$, and the center
of momentum, $K$, is kept real, since equation~(\ref{eq:transformed}) is an integral equation in the relative
momentum $k$ only. 
The normalization of the 2p2h states follow the generalized $c$-product as described for 
the free scattering case. 

\subsection{Pairing instabilities and resonance-like phenomena for the CD-Bonn interaction.}
Here we give a numerical calculation of 2p2h pair states in symmetric nuclear matter
using the realistic CD-Bonn \cite{machleidt} nucleon-nucleon interaction.
We use a free single particle spectrum with no gap in the calculations.
The 2p2h complex pole trajectories of the virtual states in the 
${}^1S_0$ channels are considered with increasing fermi momentum ($k_f$) and center
of momentum ($K$).
The 2p2h eigenvalue 
problem is solved on the contour $C$ consisting of a rotated and a translated part as 
shown in figure~\ref{fig:medium1}.
The singularity structure of the interaction is the same as for free scattering, 
the only modification is the angle averaged Pauli operartor entering the integral equation
\footnote{See Paper I for a discussion of the singularity structure of the CD-Bonn potential}.   
Figure~\ref{fig:1s0pole} gives the $^1S_0$ 2p and 2h complex pair states for $K = 0$ MeV and increasing
fermi momentum. Observe that the 2p2h pair states approaches the $^1S_0$ virtual states 
as $k_f \rightarrow 0 $. For $K = 0$ MeV the 2p2h pair states are located in the upper half 
complex $k$-plane. In this case integration along the real $k$-axis will give the 
complete energy spectrum, see figure~\ref{fig:1s0pole}. 
It is worth noting that the imaginary part of the 2p2h complex energy fits remarkably well 
with the pairing gap obtained from the BCS gap equation using a free single particle spectrum, 
see e.g. Ref.~\cite{morten2}.
This serves to illustrates that the BCS gap equation is an approximate solution of the 
2p2h eigenvalue problem as pointed out in Ref.~\cite{dick1,dick2,dick3}

circles:  $t_z = 0$. $k_f \in [0, 280] $ MeV, $ \Delta k_f = 10$ MeV.}
\label{fig:1s0pole}
\end{figure}
Pairing correlations may also appear for $K > 0$.
Figure~\ref{fig:1s0virtual} gives the $^1S_0$ 2p complex pole trajectory for increasing 
center of momentum and fixed fermi momentum. The complex pole move towards the real energy 
axis and eventually through the branch cut and 
onto the non-physical energy sheet with increasing center of momentum.
Translated to the momentum plane, this implies that  
the complex pole will move from the upper half $k$-plane and onto the lower half complex $k$-plane 
for a given center of momentum $K_{min}$. In the case $K > K_{min}$ the complete 2p2h 
energy spectrum is no longer obtainable by integrating along the real $k$-axis. 
By a suitable choice of contour CDM provides a method for obtaining the 
complete 2p2h energy spectrum for any $K > K_{min} $.

\label{fig:1s0virtual}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:poles1} gives a scetch of the $^1S_0$ 2p2h pole trajectories in nuclear matter. 
First the center of momentum is held fixed and equal $K = 0$ and the fermi momentum is varied. 
The 2p and 2h poles will move symmetrically to the imaginary axis in the upper half complex
$k$-plane. Thereafter the fermi momentum is held fixed and the center of momentum is varied $K > 0$.
In this case the 2p and 2h poles will move towards the real $k$-axis and for a given $K$ into the
lower half complex $k$-plane.

$k_f$ is held fixed.}

\subsection{Calculation of $\Gamma $ by CDM for the CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon interaction.}
In this section we will discuss a method for solving the full off-shell
vertex function (effective interaction), $\Gamma$, in a nuclear medium.
This method is based on analytic continuation of the integral equations and
expansion of the Green`s function on a complete set of Berggren states. This is
known as the Lehmann representation of the effective interaction $\Gamma $.
 
For two nucleons in free space the vertex function reduces to 
the  $t$-matrix, and hence the free full two-body scattering problem. 
In free space the $t$-matrix can be interpreted as an effective interaction
between two nucleons. In a scattering process the $t$-matrix
includes repeated two body interactions to infinite order, i.e. a summation of
all ladder diagrams to infinite order. In analouge to the free scattering case, 
we will consider only repeated interactions between either hole or particle states in 
the medium, giving the 2p2h ladder summed vertex function, $\Gamma $. 

The integral equation (\ref{eq:effective1}) for the effective interaction may be
written in relative and center of momentum coordinates by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gamma_mat1}
\Gamma_l(k,k'; \omega) = V_l(k,k') + \int_{0}^{\infty}dq q^2 V_l(k,q)
g_{II}^{FG(0)}(q,\omega)\Gamma_l(q,k'; \omega)  
\end{equation}
where we introduce the shorthand notation $\Gamma_l(k,k'; \omega) = \Gamma_l(k,k',K,k_f; \omega) $. 
The non-interacting 2p2h propagator is given, 
\begin{equation}
  g_{II}^{FG(0)}(k,\omega) = {\bar{Q}(k,K;k_f)\over \omega - H_0(k,K) }
\end{equation}
In the case of free scattering $Q=1$, and equation~(\ref{eq:gamma_mat1}) reduces
to the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the $t$-matrix given in equation~(\ref{eq:tmat3}). 
The spectral representation of the effective interaction takes the following form
in RCM coordinates
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:gamma_mat2}
  \Gamma_l(k,k'; \omega) = V_l(k,k') + \int_{0}^{\infty}dq q^2 
  \int_0^\infty dq' {q'}^2 V_l(k,q) g_{II}^{FG}(q,q';\omega) V_{l}(q',k')
\end{equation}
where the interacting 2p2h propagator is given by equation~(\ref{eq:int_prop}).
We will consider the solution of
Equation~(\ref{eq:gamma_mat2}) for the effective interaction by CDM. 
Using the completeness relation defined on a distorted contour $C$, shown in figure~\ref{fig:medium1}, 
gives the Berggren representation of the effective interaction in a nuclear medium, 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_l(k,k'; \omega) = V_l(k,k') + \int_C dz z^2 
\int_C dz' {z'}^2 V_l(k,z) g_{II}^{FG}(z,z';\omega) V_{l}(z',k')
\end{equation}
here the interacting 2p2h propagator are represented in the 2p2h basis obtained by 
solving the eigenvalue problem in equation~(\ref{eq:transformed}).

By applying CDM and the spectral representation of the effective interaction,
we are able to single out the bound and resonant state contribution from the non-resonant 
2p2h continuum contribution  to the full effective interaction. 
The effective interaction may be written in the form,
\begin{displaymath}
\Gamma(\omega) = V + \Delta\Gamma(\omega) = V + \Delta\Gamma^R(\omega) + \Delta\Gamma^C(\omega), 
\end{displaymath}
here $R$ denotes the discrete bound and resonant states, $C$ denotes 
the non-resonant continuum contributions. 
In this way we may study the resonant, $\Delta\Gamma ^{R}$, and non-resonant 
contributions, $\Delta\Gamma ^{C}$, to the effective interaction separately. 
In figure~\ref{fig:eff} the effective interaction $\Gamma $ 
for the input energy $ \omega = ( k^2 + K^2 )/2m_{n} $, center of momentum 
$K=30$MeV and Fermi momentum $k_f=170$MeV 
is given for   $^1S_0$ neutron-neutron channel in the CD-Bonn interaction. 
A sharp peak is observed around the Fermi surface, indicating the existence of 
bound pair states. In figure~\ref{fig:eff5} the non-resonant continuum contribution 
to the effective interaction is plotted, and it is seen that the peak 
around the Fermi surface has disappeared. The Discontinuties in the non-resonant
contribution is due to the analytic structure of the angle averaged Pauli operator given 
in equations.~(\ref{eq:pauli1},\ref{eq:pauli2}, \ref{eq:pauli3}). In figure~\ref{fig:eff6}
the resonant contribution to the effective interaction is given.
The resonant contribution displays a sharp peak around the Fermi surface, 
while the resonant contributions are neglible moving away from the Fermi surface.
 
In conclusion, CDM will enable us to 
obtain $\Gamma_{l}(k,k',K;\omega) $ for both real and complex input energies $\omega $. 
The integral becomes non-singular on the deformed contour for real 
input energies $\omega $, resulting in numerically stable solutions for
two-body scattering in both free space and in a uniform medium.   
In this perspective, CDM offers an alternative approach to the standard
PV prescription in solving for the effective interaction, and
offers a valuable tool in descrbing different contributions to the
effective interaction.
