\section{The Gamow shell model}
\label{sec:gamow_shell_model}
The standard nuclear shell model often starts with a harmonic oscillator
representation for the single particle states. 
Since the harmonic oscillator potential 
is an infinite potential, the tail in single particle wave function 
falls off to rapidly in order to describe realistically 
single particle motion near the scattering continuum. The harmonic
oscillator may therefore be said to work only for deeply bound nucleons. 
In order for the nuclear shell model to be applicable to nuclei 
far from the valley of stability, the harmonic oscillator picture 
of single particle motion has to be abdoned. The proximity of the
scattering continuum in  loosely bound and unbound nuclei, necessitates
a modification and reformulation of the standard nuclear shell model.

From the previous sections, it was shown how a single particle
basis consisting of bound, anti-bound and resonant states may be
constructed using the Contour Deformation Method in momentum space. 
Solving the momentum space integral equation on a discretized
contour in the complex $k$-plane a complex symmetric eigenvalue
problem for the single particle states 
where obtained, and from which a complete set of
\emph{bi-orthogonal} states follows. Since the basis 
is discretized on a deformed contour it is possible
to assign a unique quantum number to each single particle state.
In the case of harmonic oscillator 
states we have the usual notation for the quantum numbers
$(n,l,j) $ where $n$ is nodal number and $(lj)$ the orbital- 
and total angular momentum of the single particle state.
In the general case where bound, anti-bound, resonances and
non-resonant continuum states are treated on equal footing, 
the meaning of the quantum number $n$ has to be redefined and 
clarified. Since all single particle states have a discrete energy 
associated with them, it is natural to let $n$ refer to
the $n$'th discrete energy $E_n$. Defining $n$ is manner, all 
single particle states have a unique set of quantum number $n,l,j$.
figure~\ref{fig:sp_orb} illustrates how $N$ single particle Berggren orbitals for 
a given $(lj)$ partial wave,
obtained by solving the momentum space Schr\"odinger equation on a $N$-point 
discretized contour in the complex $k$-plane, 
may be organized in an ordered way. The non-resonant continuum orbitals are
distinguished from the discrete bound- and resonant orbitals.

\caption{Illustration of how the bound, resonant and non-resonant continuum 
orbitals for a given $(lj)$ single particle configuration may be organized in 
an ordered way.} 
\label{fig:sp_orb}
\end{figure} 
Having constructed a single-particle Berggren basis, a many-body Berggren basis
may be constructed in a completely analogous way as when 
harmonic oscillator states are used. We construct a complete anti-symmetric 
$N$-body basis from the Slater determinants consisting of the 
Berggren orbitals $\varphi_{nljm} $ 
i.e. 
\begin{equation}
  \Phi_{\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n}(1,...,n) = {1\over \sqrt{n !}}
  \left| \begin{array}{ccc} 
    \varphi_{\alpha_1}(1) & \ldots &  \varphi_{\alpha_1}(n) \\
    \vdots &  & \vdots \\
    \varphi_{\alpha_n}(1) & \ldots &  \varphi_{\alpha_N}(n) 
    \end{array}\right|,
\end{equation} 
where $\alpha_i$ labels the single particle quantum numbers $(n_il_ij_im_i)$. 
The Slater determinant have eigenvalues 
$E_{i} = \varepsilon_{\alpha_1} + ... + \varepsilon_{\alpha_N}$, which is just the sum 
of all single particle energies. Here the label $i$ subsumes all the 
different single particle quantum numbers 
$ \varepsilon_{\alpha_1} + ... + \varepsilon_{\alpha_N}$.
We then have at hand a complete set of $N$ many-body Slater determinants, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  1 = \sum_i^N \vert \Phi_i \rangle \langle \Phi_i^*\vert,
\end{equation}
which the exact many-body wave function may be expanded in. 
The shell model problem then
requires the solution of a complex symmetric $N\times N$
matrix eigenvalue equation,  
\begin{equation}
  H \vert \Psi_i \rangle = E_i \vert \Psi_i \rangle, 
\end{equation}
with $i = 1,...,N$. Representing the shell model states in a complete set of 
Slater determinants, built from 
the single particle orbitals with quantum numbers $(nljm)$, 
is commonly known as the $m$-scheme representation.  The Slater 
determinants are antisymmetric and have definite values of the total 
spin projection $M_J = m_1+m_2+...+m_n $ and total isospin projection  
$M_T = \tau_1 + \tau_2 +...+\tau_n$, but they are not states with 
good quantum number of total spin $J$ and isospin $T$. In 
standard large-scale shell model calculations, using the the $m$-scheme representation, 
one is typically interested
in the the first few low lying energy states. The Lanczos algorithm \cite{lanczo}   
is an iterative method which has proven to be efficient in solving for a limited set 
of eigenvalues of large real symmetric matrices. 

In the Gamow Shell Model case, the $m$-scheme and the standard Lanczos iterartion
technique for solving large eigenvalue problem for real symmetric matrices are not 
optimal approaches. Firstly, the $m$-scheme representation 
of the shell model equations does not automatically split the 
full shell model matrix into 
smaller sub-martices for different values of the total spin $J$ 
and isospin $T$. In standard shell model calculations only bound states appear, 
but in Gamow Shell Model, not only bound states but a rather large set 
of continuum states are included for each $lj$ configuration. 
In a $m$-scheme represenation, the dimension of the matrix will, 
in the Gamow Shell Model case, in most cases be too large 
to handle numerically. 
On the other hand, one may construct a  
many-body basis coupled to definite total spin $J$ and $T$, either by
the $j-j$ or the $L-S$ coupling scheme. Thereafter the shell model 
equations for a given value of spin and isospin may be
diagonalized separately.  The dimension of each $J,T$ 
matrix will then be considerably smaller than the full 
matrix represented in the $m$-scheme.  For Gamow Shell Model
calculations the $j-j$ or the $L-S$ coupling scheme seems to be the 
most suitable representations.
Secondly, the Lanczos iteration method has usually been used for 
calculation of a set of eigenvalues lowest in real energy. 
In Gamow Shell Model calculations there may be  a large 
number of complex continuum states
lying below the physical resonances in real energy.
In addition it is difficult to
predict where the multi-particle resonances will appear after diagonalization. 
Direct diganalization procedures has to be abdoned, since
the matrices with increasing number of valence particles soon become 
too large to store and handle on most modern computers. 
However, as will be shown in the next section, the Lanczos iteration technique
may be generalized to complex symmetric matrices. Choosing 
a reasonable initial Lanczos vector for the multi-particle resonance, 
it will be shown that the Lanczos iteration procedure gives accurate
and converged results for the multi-particle resonance 
with a fairly small number of iterations. 

Choosing to work Slater determinants coupled to definite spin, 
the $N-$body anti-symmetric wave function can be constructed viz., 
\begin{equation}
  \Psi_\alpha^{JM} (1,...,N) = \sum_{i} C_{i}^{JM} {\Phi}_{i}^{JM}(1,...,N), 
  \label{eq:twobody_antisym}
\end{equation}
where the indice $i$ represent the various single-particle orbits.
Here ${\Phi}_{i}^J(1,...,N) $ is a normalized $N-$body anti-symmetric 
wave function.  The shell model equations we have to solve is then given 
by 
\begin{equation}
  H \vert \Psi_i^J \rangle = E_i^J \vert \Psi_i^J \rangle, 
\end{equation}
In our Gamow Shell Model studies of $^{6-7}$He 
in Paper II, we worked within the $j-j$ coupling scheme. See 
Appendix~\ref{sec:3matel} for the derivation of 
three-body matrix elements in $j-j$ coupling.
Table~\ref{tab:dimension} gives the various dimension for the 
shell model matrices with definite spin and parity $J^\pi$ for
the different $^{5-7}$He isotopes considered in Paper II. 
It is seen that with a valence space of 24 $p_{1/2}$ and 24 $p_{3/2}$ 
single particle orbitals, the dimension grows extremely fast with 
increasing number of valence particles. Even in the case of three valence
particles the dimension is too large for direct diagonalization procedures. 
This problem of the dimensionality of the Gamow Shell Model equations
is what we call the \emph{dimensionality problem}.

In order to be able to solve for the eigenvalue 
spectrum of such large complex matrices, 
effective interaction techniques and matrix perturbation theory 
generalized for complex symmetric matrices have to be developed and studied. 
This is the topic of the next sections.


\section{Lanczos iteration process for many-body resonances.}
\label{sec:lanczo}
The Lanczos iteration technique for finding a limited 
set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for large real matrices, 
has over the years been the dominating approach in solving large-scale
shell model equations. The 
method may easily be generalized to apply for complex matrices. This suggest that 
the method may be a suitable approach for dealing with 
large complex symmetric matrices which appear in Gamow Shell Model
studies. However, we need a reliable prescription for
identifying which state is to be associated with the physical
multi-particle resonance from the set of eigenvectors obtained
from diagonalizing the Lanczos matrix. Below we shall show 
how such a prescription may be defined. As a test case 
we consider the bound and resonant spectra of $^6$He, using 
a shell model picture with two valence neutrons moving in $p_{3/2}$ 
Berggren orbitals outside a  $^4$He core. We use 24 single discretization points 
for the contour in generating the $p_{3/2}$ single particle basis of $^5$He. 
See Paper II for further details on the contour, the $^4$He -$n$ 
interaction potential and
on the residual nucleon-nucleon interaction for the two valence nucleons. 

The many-body basis in which we expand the shell model wave function, 
is constructed from Slater determinants built from  the single 
particle Berggren orbitals in a given valence space, and coupled to total 
spin $J$ since we work in a $j-j$ coupling scheme.
corresponding Hamiltonian may be represented in this basis. 
For the Lanczos iteration scheme to converge rapidly, the
choice of a 0th order approximation to the multi-particle resonance should
resemble the exact multi-particle resonance as much as possible. Constructing
a reasonable starting vector for the Lanczos iteration procedure, is 
what we have to consider firstly. Having constructed a complete many-body 
basis from the single particle Berggren orbitals, the many-body space
may be partioned into a model space $P$ and an orthogonal complement space
$Q$ by some selection procedure. 
The shell model Hamiltonian may then
subsequently be partioned into two parts according to, 
\begin{equation} 
H =  \left( \begin{array}{cc}
    PHP & PHQ \\ 
    QHP & QHQ  
  \end{array} \right)  =  
  \left( \begin{array}{cc}
    H^{PP} & 0 \\ 
    0 & 0 
  \end{array} \right) 
  +
  \left( \begin{array}{cc}
    0 & H^{PQ} \\ 
    H^{QP} & H^{QQ}  
  \end{array} \right).
\end{equation}
The model space $P$ should be constructed in such a way that the most important 
many-body configurations of the many-body resonance wave function 
are included in this restricted space. Furthermore, the dimension $N_P$ of the model space
$P$ should be small enough so that a full diagonalization of $H^{PP} $ is possible.
The 0th order lanczos vector $\vert \mathrm{lanc}_0\rangle $, which is the 0th order 
approximation to the exact wave function,  is then obtained by diagonalizing 
the $N_P\times N_P$ model space matrix $H^{PP}$. In choosing the model space $P$ 
it is natural to assume that the most important configurations are those in which 
all or several particles are in single particle resonance orbitals. The $Q$-space 
consists then of the remaining configurations. In the $^6$He test case we
consider two different model spaces $P = P_1, \:P_2$. 
In the first case we let $P$ be given by a single Slater determinant, 
where both neutrons are in the $p_{3/2}$ single particle resonance orbital, 
i.e. $P_1 = \vert RR \rangle $. In this case the 
0th order lanczos vector is just the single Slater determninant,
\begin{equation}
  \vert \mathrm{lanc}_0 \rangle = \vert \Phi_i^J \rangle = \vert RR \rangle. 
  \label{eq:start1}
\end{equation}  
In the second choice we construct $P$ from all Slater determinants 
where at least one neutron is in the $p_{3/2}$ 
single particle resonance orbital, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  P_2 \equiv  \left\{ \vert RR \rangle, \vert RC\rangle \right\},
\end{equation}
and the corresponding model space dimension is $N_{P_2} = 24$. 
In this case the 0th order Lanczos vector is a linear combination of 
Slater determinants, 
\begin{equation}
  \vert \mathrm{lanc}_0\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{P_2}} C_{i,j}\vert \Phi_i^J \rangle.
  \label{eq:start2}
\end{equation}
Here $C$ is a $N_{P_2}\times N_{P_2}$   orthogonal matrix 
which diagonalizes $H^{PP}$. 
The orthogonal columns $j$ of $C$ have been 
normalized so that $\vert \mathrm{lanc}_0\rangle  $ is normalized.  
For each Slater determinant $\vert \Phi_i \rangle,\:\: i=1,...,N_{P_2}$  a corresponding 
amplitude $C_{i,j}$ is assigned. As the diagonalization of the model 
space matrix $H^{PP}$ 
gives $N_{P_2}$ possible choices for the 0th order 
Lanczos vector, we have to determine from this set 
which is the 0th order approximation 
to the exact two-particle resonance wave function. 
This may be done by considering each column $j$ of the matrix $C$, 
and determine which of these columns have the largest amplitude $C_{i,j}$ for
the Slater determinant where all particles are in single particle 
resonance orbitals.

The Lanczos iteration procedure may be summarized by the following steps,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose an initial Lanczos vector $\vert \mathrm{lanc}_0\rangle $ 
  ( a linear combination of Slater determinants ) as the 0th order approximation 
  to the exact multi-particle resonance wave function. See discussion above, on how 
  to choose this starting vector for Gamow Shell Model applications. 
\item The next step involves generating a new vector $ \vert \mathrm{new}_{p+1}\rangle $ 
  by letting 
  the full Hamiltonain $H$ act on the $p$'th Lanczos vector $\vert \mathrm{lanc}_p\rangle $, i.e. 
  $ \vert \mathrm{new}_{p+1}\rangle = H \mathrm{lanc}_p\rangle  $.
  Throughout this process we construct the energy matrix elements of $H$ 
  in this Lanczos basis. The diagonal matrix elements of $H$ are then 
  obtained by
  \begin{equation}
    \langle \mathrm{lanc}_p \vert H \vert \mathrm{lanc}_p \rangle = 
    \langle \mathrm{lanc}_p \vert \mathrm{new}_{p+1} \rangle.
  \end{equation}
\item The new vector $ \vert \mathrm{new}_{p+1} \rangle $ is 
  then orthogonalized to all previously calculated Lanczos vectors
  by the Gram-Schmidt procedure 
  \begin{equation}
    \vert \mathrm{new}_{p+1}' \rangle = 
    \vert \mathrm{new}_{p+1} \rangle - 
    \sum_{q=0}^p \vert \mathrm{lanc}_{q} \rangle 
    \langle \mathrm{lanc}_q \vert \mathrm{new}_{p+1}\rangle,
  \end{equation} 
  and normalized 
  \begin{equation}
    \vert \mathrm{lanc}_{p+1}\rangle = {1 \over 
      \sqrt{ \langle \mathrm{new}_{p+1}'\vert \mathrm{new}_{p+1}'\rangle } }
    \vert \mathrm{new}_{p+1}'\rangle,
  \end{equation} 
  to give a new normalized Lanczos vector.
\item The off-diagonal matrix elements of $H$ is then obtained by
  \begin{equation}
    \langle \mathrm{lanc}_{p+1}\vert H \vert \mathrm{lanc}_{p}\rangle = 
    \langle \mathrm{lanc}_{p+1}\vert \mathrm{new}_{p+1}'\rangle,
  \end{equation}
  and all other matrix elements are zero. 
\item After $p$ iterations we have an energy matrix of 
  tridiagonal form 
  \begin{equation}
    \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc}
	H_{0,0} & H_{0,1} &   0     & \ldots & 0 \\
	H_{1,0} & H_{1,1} & H_{1,2} & \ldots & 0 \\
	0       & H_{2,1} & H_{2,2} & \ldots & 0 \\
	\vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots & H_{p-1,p} \\
	0       &   0     &   0     & H_{p,p-1} & H_{p,p} 
      \end{array} \right]
  \end{equation}
  as the $p$'th approximation to the full eigenvalue problem. 
  The number $p$ is a reasonably small number so the matrix
  can be diagonalized by standard diagonalization routines
  for sparse matrices of tridiagonal form, to obtain eigenvalues and 
  eigenvectors which are linear combinations of the Lanczos vectors. 
\item This process is repeated until a suitable convergence criterion has been
  reached.
\end{enumerate}
Having determined a converged Lanczos energy matrix, 
the remaining problem is how to determine which of the states
$\vert \Psi_i(p) \rangle, \:\: i = 1,...,p$ gives the 
$p$'th approximation to the exact multi-particle resonance.  
This identification may be done unambigously by determining 
which state $\vert \Psi_i(p) \rangle, \:\: i = 1,...,p$
has the largest overlap with the initial Lanczos vector $\vert \mathrm{lanc}_0\rangle $, 
which is the
0th order approximation to the exact multi-particle resonance.

using
the starting vector given in equation~(\ref{eq:start1}) (solid line) 
and the starting vector given in equation~(\ref{eq:start2}) (dashed line).
It is seen 
that both for the real and imaginary parts of the energy, 
the convergence is  faster for
the initial Lanczos vector given in equation~(\ref{eq:start2})
than compared with the convergence using the initial 
vector in equation~(\ref{eq:start1}). However, it is interesting to see that
both choices 
converges to the exact ground state energy $E(0^+) = -0.98 +0.00i $MeV 
within the number of iterations $p$ considered. 
Figures~\ref{fig:lanczo3} and \ref{fig:lanczo4} 
gives the approximate real and imaginary parts of the
$2^+$ resonant state of $^6$He obtained after $p$ iterations, using
the starting vector given in equation~(\ref{eq:start1}) (solid line) 
and the starting vector given in equation~(\ref{eq:start2}) (dashed line).
Also in this case convergence is faster using equation~(\ref{eq:start2}) 
for an initial Lanczos vector. Both choices converges to the 
exact two-particle resonance energy $E(2^+) = 1.216 - 0.268i$MeV for a reasonable
small number of iterations $p$.
This test study of  the Lanczos iteration procedure
applied to Gamow Shell Model studies, is very promising. 
Both resonances and bound states are reproduced with a 
small number of iterations, given a reasonable choice for
a 0th order approximation to the two-particle resonance wave function.

\section{Similarity transformations and effective operators for complex interactions.}
\label{sec:lee_suzuki}

The previous section served to introduce and motivate the application of complex scaling
and a Berggren basis
in studies of weakly bound nuclear systems. However, employing such a momentum space basis soon exceeds 
feasible dimensionalities in shell-model studies. 
To circumvent this problem and to be able to define
effective interactions of practical use in shell-model calculations, 
we introduce effective two-body interactions
based on similarity transformation methods. These interactions are in 
turn employed in Gamow shell model calculations. 
We base our approach on the extensive works of Suzuki, Okamoto, Lee and collaborators, see for example
Refs.~\cite{suzuki1,suzuki2,suzuki3,suzuki4}.
This similarity transformation method has been widely used in the
construction of a effective two- and three-body interactions for use in
the No-Core shell-model approach of Barrett, Navratil, Vary and collaborators, see for 
example Refs.~\cite{bruce1,bruce2,bruce3,bruce4}  
and references therein. However, since  
the similarity transformation method has previously 
only been considered for real interactions, we need to extend
its use to Gamow shell model calculations, implying a generalization 
to complex interactions. 

We start with the abstract formulation of the two-body Schr\"odinger equation,
\begin{equation} 
\left(H_0 + V \right) \vert\Psi_k\rangle = E_k\vert\Psi_k\rangle,
\label{eq:full_ham}
\end{equation}
here $H_0$ includes the single-particle part of the Hamiltonian, kinetic energy and 
an eventual single-particle potential. The term $V$ is the residual two-body interaction. 
The Hamiltonian, $H=H_0 + V$, is here a complex symmetric matrix, i.e. $H = H^\mathrm{T}$
\footnote{Here $H^{\mathrm{T}}$ means the transpose of $H$.},  since
the equations are analytically continued to the complex $k$-plane, and the eigenvalue
problem is no longer Hermitian. 
The eigenvectors form a complete \emph{bi-orthogonal} set, and are
normalized according to the \emph{bi-linear} form, 
\[ 
\langle \tilde{\Psi}_k \vert \Psi_{k'} \rangle = 
\langle \Psi_k^*\vert \Psi_{k'}\rangle = \delta_{k,k'},
\]
Here the left eigenvector $ \langle \tilde{\Psi}_k \vert $ is just 
the transpose of the right eigenvector $\vert \Psi_k \rangle$, which follows 
from the fact the Hamiltonian is complex symmetric (see Appendix~\ref{sec:biort} for details).
\footnote{In the following we will use the notation for the bi-orthogonal 
states $ \langle \tilde{\Psi}_k \vert  = \langle \Psi_k^* \vert $ which are
the left eigenvectors of a complex symmetric matrix. This is for 
distinguishing them from the bi-orthogonal states $\langle \tilde{\phi}_k \vert $ 
which are left eigenvectors of non-symmetric matrices, which gives
$\langle \tilde{\phi}_k \vert \ne \langle {\phi}_k^* \vert  $ }
The Hilbert space is now divided in two subspaces, i.e. a model space
and a complement space. The operators which project onto the model space 
and onto its complement space are labeled $P$ and $Q$, respectively. 
 The projection operators fulfill the relations 
\begin{equation}
P^2 = P, \;\; Q^2 = Q, \;\; P^{\mathrm{T}} = P,
\label{eq:P_op}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
Q^{\mathrm{T}} = Q, \;\; P + Q = 1, \;\; PQ = 0.
\label{eq:Q_op}
\end{equation} 
The projection operators are typically chosen to be the eigenprojectors of the 
one-body operator $H_0$, i.e. they are constructed from the basis
which diagonalizes $H_0$,
\begin{equation} 
  \langle {\alpha}^*\vert \: H_0 \: \vert \alpha' \rangle = \varepsilon_i \delta_{\alpha,\alpha'}, 
  \label{eq:h0}
\end{equation}
from which they have the explicit form,
\begin{equation} 
  {P} = \sum_{\alpha_{P}} \vert \alpha_{P}\rangle
  \langle {\alpha}_{P}^*\vert, \:\: 
	  {Q} = \sum_{\alpha_{Q}} \vert \alpha_{Q}\rangle
	  \langle {\alpha}_{Q}^*\vert, 
\end{equation}
From this particular choice it follows, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber
  \left[ H_0,P\right] = \left[ H_0,Q\right] = 0, \\
  QH_0P = PH_0Q = 0.
\end{eqnarray}
The aim is to construct an effective Hamiltonian within the $P-$space, 
for which every eigenvalue of the effective Hamiltonian corresponds to one
of the exact eigenvalues of full Hamiltonian $H$. 
This can be accomplished by a similarity transformation of the full Hamiltonian, 
\begin{equation} 
  \tilde{H} = X^{-1} H X, \:\: \vert \Phi_k \rangle = X^{-1}\vert \Psi_k \rangle, 
\end{equation} 
%The matrix $X$ is a complex orthogonal matrix, i.e.  
%\begin{equation}
%  X^\mathrm{T}X = XX^\mathrm{T} = 1, \:\: X^\mathrm{T} = X^{-1}.
%\end{equation}
%Such complex orthogonal transformations conserves the norm of the 
%eigenvectors, 
%\begin{equation} 
%\langle \tilde{\Phi}_k \vert \Phi_k \rangle = 
%\langle \tilde{\Phi}_k \vert \:X^\mathrm{T}X \: \vert \Phi_k \rangle = 
%\langle \tilde{\Psi}_k \vert \Psi_k \rangle = 1.
%\end{equation}
Representing the Schr\"odinger equation in the basis of the one-body 
operator $H_0$, it can be rewritten in the $2\times 2$ block structure, 
\begin{equation}
\left( \begin{array}{cc}
P\tilde{H}P & P\tilde{H}Q \\ 
Q\tilde{H}P & Q\tilde{H}Q 
\end{array} \right) 
\left( \begin{array}{c} 
P\Phi_k \\
Q\Phi_k 
\end{array} \right) = 
E_k \left( \begin{array}{c} 
P\Phi_k \\
Q\Phi_k 
\end{array} \right).
\label{eq:block}
\end{equation}
which gives the equations, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:m_space1}
  P\tilde{H}P \vert \Phi_k \rangle +  P\tilde{H}Q  \vert \Phi_k \rangle 
  = E_k P \vert \Phi_k \rangle \\
  \label{eq:m_space2}
  Q\tilde{H}P \vert \Phi_k \rangle +  Q\tilde{H}Q  \vert \Phi_k \rangle 
  = E_k Q \vert \Phi_k \rangle 
\end{eqnarray}
Where we have used $P^2 = P $ and $ Q^2 = Q$. Solving equation~(\ref{eq:m_space2}) for 
$Q \vert \Phi_k \rangle $, and inserting into equation~(\ref{eq:m_space2}), yields 
an effective eigenvalue problem in the $P$-space, 
\begin{equation}
  \left( P\tilde{H}P  +  P\tilde{H}Q {1 \over E_k - Q\tilde{H} Q } Q\tilde{H}P\right) P \vert \Phi_k \rangle 
  = E_k P \vert \Phi_k \rangle \\
\end{equation}
This effective Hamiltonian depends on the exact eigenvalue $E_k$ of the full problem.
However, if a similarity transformation matrix $X$ is chosen such  that 
the decoupling equation, 
\begin{equation}
  Q\tilde{H}P = Q (X^{-1}HX ) P =0,
  \label{eq:decoup}
\end{equation}
is satisfied, then we end up with an effective Hamiltonian in the $P$-space
which is energy independent, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
  \left( P\tilde{H}P \right)  P \vert \Phi_k \rangle = E_k P \vert \Phi_k \rangle 
  \label{eq:eff_ham1}
\end{equation}
There are infinitely many different transformations $X$ which decouple 
the $P$- and $Q$-spaces, see e.g. Refs.~\cite{holt,okamoto}. Here we choose 
the Lee-Suzuki (LS) similarity transformation, see Ref.~\cite{suzuki1}. The LS transformation 
is the simplest transformation, and given by, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  X & = & \exp(\omega) \\
  \Rightarrow \tilde{H}_{LS} &= &\exp(-\omega )H\exp(\omega), \:\:
  \vert \Phi_k \rangle = \exp(-\omega) \vert \Psi_k \rangle,
\end{eqnarray}     
here $\omega $ has the property,
\begin{equation} 
  \omega = Q \omega P,
  \label{eq:omega}
\end{equation}
where it is seen that $\omega $ acts as  a mapping between the $P$ and $Q$ spaces.
From equation~(\ref{eq:omega}) it follows that $ \omega^2 = \omega^3  = ... = 0$ and 
the transformation operators  $X$ and $X^{-1}$ simplify to 
\begin{equation}
  X = \exp(\omega ) = 1 + \omega, \:\: X^{-1} = \exp(-\omega) = 1-\omega,
  \label{eq:omega2}
\end{equation}
for which it immediately follows for the effective Hamiltonian and interaction in the
$P$-space, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
P\tilde{H}_{LS} P & = & PH (P+\omega), \\
PV_{LS}P  & = & PH (P+\omega) - PH_0P =  PVP+PV\omega 
= PVP + PVQ\omega,
\label{eq:ls_int}
\end{eqnarray}
Where we have used the identity $Q\omega = Q\omega P = \omega $.
\footnote{In Ref.~\cite{okamoto} 
Okamoto \emph{et. al.} classified all 
energy independent effective interactions in the time independent approach, 
and formally showed that they may be written as 
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\tilde{H}(m,n) = (P+\omega^\dagger \omega )^{-m}H(P+\omega)(P+\omega^\dagger \omega)^n.
\end{equation}
Where $m,n$ are integers of half-integers.
For $m=n=0$ the non-Hermitian Lee-Suzuki effective interaction in equation~(\ref{eq:ls_int}), 
which is the simplest transformation, is obtained.}
The decoupling equation~(\ref{eq:decoup}) becomes, 
\begin{equation} 
QHP + QHQ\omega - \omega PHP - \omega PHQ\omega = 0.
\label{eq:decoupling}
\end{equation}
The $P$-space Schr\"odinger equation~(\ref{eq:eff_ham1}) now becomes, 
\begin{equation}
  P (H_0 + V_{LS})P \vert \phi_k \rangle = E_k \vert \phi_k \rangle 
  \label{eq:eff_ham2}
\end{equation}
where $ \vert \phi_k \rangle = P\vert \Phi_k \rangle $. 
The true eigen state $\Psi_k$ of the original Schr\"odinger equation~(\ref{eq:full_ham}) 
is related to the $P$-space eigen state $\phi_k$ of equation~(\ref{eq:eff_ham2}) 
in the following way,
\begin{equation}
  \vert \Psi_k \rangle = X P \vert \Phi_k \rangle = \exp(\omega) P \vert \Phi_k \rangle 
  = (P +\omega )\vert \phi_k \rangle.
\end{equation} 
Here it is seen that $ \omega\vert \phi_k\rangle $ is the $Q$-space component of the true 
eigen state $\vert \Psi_k \rangle$. The eigenvalue problem for the 
$P$-space eigen states in equation~(\ref{eq:eff_ham2}), is of a non-symmetric 
type. This means that the left and right eigenvectors form a complete
bi-orthogonal set. Solving for the left eigenvectors $ \langle \tilde{\phi}_k\vert $
of equation~(\ref{eq:eff_ham2}) which are \emph{bi-orthogonal} to the right eigenvectors
(see Appendix~\ref{sec:biort} for details) $\vert \phi_k \rangle $, we get
\begin{equation}
\langle \tilde{\phi}_k\vert \phi_{k'}\rangle = \delta_{k,k'}, 
\end{equation}
Using the orthogonality of the true eigenvectors in equation~(\ref{eq:full_ham}) 
we may derive a relationship between the left and right eigenvectors,
\begin{equation}
  \langle \Psi_k^* \vert \Psi_{k'} \rangle = 
  \langle \phi_k^* \vert (P +\omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega) \vert \phi_{k'} \rangle 
  = \delta_{k,k'},
\end{equation}
from which the following properties follow, 
\begin{equation}
  \langle \tilde{\phi}_k \vert = \langle \phi_k^*\vert (P + \omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega ),
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  (P + \omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega ) = (P + \omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega )^{\mathrm{T}}. 
  \label{eq:omega_mat}
\end{equation}
Given the left and right eigenvectors of the LS effective Hamiltonian, 
the formal solution to $\omega $ is given by,
\begin{equation}
\omega = \sum_{k=1}^d Q \vert \Psi_k \rangle \langle \tilde{ \phi}_k \vert P,
\label{eq:omega3}
\end{equation}
here $ d = N_P$ is the dimension of the $P$-space.
The solution to $\omega $ is ambiguous in the sense 
that how to choose the $N_P$ exact eigen states $ \vert \Psi_k \rangle$
is not unique. The effective interaction will depend on the choice of eigenvectors,
and this is why the LS effective interaction is often called 
a \emph{state-dependent} interaction. With the solution 
to $\omega $, the $N_P$ eigenvalues of the $P$-space equation will
correspond exactly with the $N_P$ arbitrary chosen eigenvalues of 
the original Schr\"odinger equation~(\ref{eq:full_ham}). Representing 
$\omega $ in the basis which diagonalizes $H_0$ ( see equation~(\ref{eq:h0}) ) 
and defines the projection operators $P$ and $Q$ gives,
\begin{equation}
  \langle \alpha^*_Q \vert \: \omega \: \vert \alpha_P \rangle = 
  \sum_{k=1}^d  \langle {\alpha}_Q^* \vert 
  \Psi_k \rangle \langle \tilde{ \phi}_k \vert \alpha_P \rangle.
  \label{eq:omega4}
\end{equation}
The bra states $ \langle \tilde{\phi}_k \vert $ may be obtained from the
true eigenstate $\vert \Psi_k \rangle $. Using the property that 
the matrix of left eigenvectors is the inverse of the matrix of 
right eigenvectors for a general matrix (see Appendix~\ref{sec:biort}), 
we get for the matrix of bra states,
\begin{equation}
  [\langle \tilde{ \phi}_k \vert \alpha_P \rangle] = 
  [\langle \alpha_P^* \vert \phi_k \rangle]^{-1} = 
  [\langle \alpha_P^* \vert \Psi_k \rangle]^{-1}.
\end{equation}
here $[...]$ refer to the full $N_P\times N_P$ matrix. 
Then $\omega $ in the represenation
of $H_0$ is given by the matrix equation,
\begin{equation}
  [\langle \alpha_Q^* \vert \: \omega \: \vert \alpha_P \rangle] =  
  [\langle \alpha_Q^* \vert \Psi_k \rangle]
  [\langle \alpha_P^* \vert \Psi_k \rangle]^{-1}.
\end{equation}
It is seen that a solution for $\omega $ is obtainable provided the 
matrix $  [\langle \alpha_Q^* \vert \Psi_k \rangle] $ is non-singular. In 
numerical implementations it is therefore preferable to choose those 
$N_P$ exact eigen states ${\Psi_k}$ which have the largest overlap 
with the $P-$space, 
$O_n = \sum_{\alpha_P}\vert \langle \Psi_n^*\vert \alpha_P \rangle \vert^2$.
The matrix elements of the LS non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in equation~(\ref{eq:ls_int}) 
in the represenation of $H_0$ (see equation~(\ref{eq:h0}) ) 
are given as, 
\begin{equation}
  \langle \alpha_P^* \vert \tilde{H}_{LS} \vert \alpha_{P}'\rangle = 
  \sum_{k=1}^d \left[ \langle \alpha_P^* \vert \Psi_k \rangle E_k 
    \langle \Psi_k^* \vert \alpha_{P}' \rangle  + 
    \sum_{\alpha_Q} \langle \alpha_P^* \vert \Psi_k \rangle \:E_k\:
    \langle \Psi_k^* \vert \alpha_Q \rangle \langle \alpha_Q^* \vert \omega \vert \alpha_P' \rangle
    \right].
\end{equation}
Here $E_k$ are the exact eigenvalues obtained by diagonalizing the full Hamiltonian 
given in equation~(\ref{eq:full_ham}). When diagonalizing the LS effective Hamiltonian,
the $E_k, \: k = 1,...,d$ exact eigenvalues are obtained.   
The LS effective interaction becomes in the represenation of $H_0$, 
\begin{equation}
  \langle \alpha_P^* \vert V_{LS} \vert \alpha_{P}'\rangle = 
  \langle \alpha_P^* \vert \tilde{H}_{LS} \vert \alpha_{P}'\rangle - 
  \varepsilon_{\alpha_P}\delta_{\alpha_P,\alpha_P'}
\end{equation}
The LS effective Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian and non-symmetric.  
It would be preferable to obtain a complex symmetric effective interaction, 
in order to take advantage of the anti-symmetrization of the two-particle basis.
This may be accomplished by a $Z$-transformation of the $P$-space states, 
\begin{equation}
  \vert \nu_k \rangle = Z \vert \phi_k \rangle,
\end{equation}
which gives the following property 
\begin{equation}
  \langle \tilde{\nu}_k\vert \nu_{k'} \rangle = 
  \langle \nu_k^* \vert \nu_{k'} \rangle = \delta_{k,k'}.
  \label{eq:ztransform}
\end{equation}
Using again the orthogonality of the true eigenstates $\vert \Psi_k \rangle $,
we get 
\begin{equation}
  \langle \Psi_k^* \vert \Psi_{k'} \rangle = 
  \langle \phi_k^* \vert (P +\omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega) \vert \phi_{k'} \rangle 
  = \langle \nu_k^* \vert (Z^{-1})^{\mathrm{T}}(P +\omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega) (Z^{-1})\vert \nu_{k'} \rangle 
  = \delta_{k,k'},
\end{equation} 
which gives the following condition for the $Z$-transformation in order for
equation~(\ref{eq:ztransform}) to be fulfilled, 
\begin{equation}
  Z^{\mathrm{T}}Z = P + \omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega.
  \label{eq:ztransform2}
\end{equation}
Having obtained a solution for $Z$ which obeys equation~(\ref{eq:ztransform2}), 
the complex symmetric (CS) effective interaction is given by, 
\begin{equation}
  V_{CS} = Z ( H_0 + V_{LS}) Z^{-1} - PH_0P. 
\end{equation}
That the $Z$-transformed LS effective Hamiltonian is complex symmetric follows from
the orthogonality in equation~(\ref{eq:ztransform}), where the left eigenvector is the 
transpose of the right eigenvector, which is the case for symmetric matrices only 
(see Appendix~\ref{sec:biort}). Refs.~\cite{holt,okamoto} derived and discussed 
several such $Z$-transformations for which a Hermitian effective interaction is obtained.
One such $Z$-transformation is,
\begin{equation}
  Z = P( 1 + \omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega )^{1/2}P. 
\end{equation}
From equation~(\ref{eq:omega_mat}) it follows that $Z = Z^{\mathrm{T}}$ 
for this particular choice, and it is easily seen that equation~(\ref{eq:ztransform2}) 
is fulfilled. This choice of $Z$  leads to an effective interaction of the 
Okubo form \cite{okubo}, 
\begin{equation}
  V_{okb} = P (1 +\omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega )^{1/2} 
  P(H_0 + V_{LS}) P(1 + \omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega )^{-1/2}P - PH_0P. 
  \label{eq:okubo}
\end{equation}
The matrix element of the Okubo effective interaction in the representation
of $H_0$ becomes, 
\begin{equation}
  \langle \alpha_P^* \vert V_{okb}\vert \alpha_{P}' \rangle = 
  \sum_{\gamma_P}\sum_{\gamma_{P}'}
  \langle \alpha_P^* \vert (P+\omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega )^{1/2} \vert \gamma_P \rangle
  \langle \gamma_P^* \vert H_{LS} \vert \gamma_P'\rangle 
  \langle \gamma_P'^*\vert  (P+\omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega )^{-1/2} \vert \alpha_P'\rangle 
  - \varepsilon_{\alpha_P}\delta_{\alpha_P,\alpha_P'}
\end{equation} 
To determine $V_{okb}$, one has to 
find the square root of the matrix 
$A = \left[ \langle \alpha^* \vert ( P + \omega ^{\mathrm{T}}\omega ) 
  \vert \alpha_P' \rangle\right]$.  
In the case of $A$ being real and positive definite the method based on
eigenvector decomposition gives generally a stable solution.
Using the eigenvector decomposition, with $X$ representing an orthogonal matrix 
with the eigenvectors of $A$ and
$D$ a diagonal matrix composed of the eigenvalues, we have the following
\begin{equation}
A  =  X D X^{T}, X^{T}X = XX^{T} = 1, D=(D)^{1/2}(D)^{1/2},
\end{equation}
which gives, 
\begin{equation}
  A  =  \left( X D^{1/2} X^{T}\right)\left( X D^{1/2} X^{T}\right),
\end{equation}
the square root of the matrix $A$ is then given by,  
\begin{equation}
  A^{1/2}  =  X D^{1/2} X^{T}.  
\end{equation}
For a complex  matrix $A$
the procedure based on eigenvector decomposition is 
generally  numerically unstable \cite{higham}. 
An approach suitable for complex matrices
is based on properties of the matrix sign function. 
It can be shown that the square root of the matrix is 
related to the matrix sign function, 
see Ref.~\cite{higham} for more details.
In the case of $A$ being complex and having all eigenvalues in the open 
right half complex plane, 
iterations based on the matrix sign function are generally more stable 
\begin{equation}
  \nonumber
  \mathrm{sign} \left( \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 
      0 & A \\
      I & 0 
    \end{array} \right] \right) = 
  \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 
      0 & A^{1/2} \\ 
      A^{-1/2} & 0  \end{array} \right]. 
\end{equation}
One stable iteration scheme for the matrix sign was derived by 
Denman and Beavers \cite{denman}, as a special case of a method for solving the 
algebraic Riccati equation
\begin{eqnarray}
  Y_0 & = &  A,\:\: Z_0 = I, \\
  Y_{k+1} & = &  {1\over2} ( Y_k + Z_k^{-1}), \\ 
  Z_{k+1} & = & {1\over2} ( Z_k + Y_k^{-1}), \:\: k = 0,1,2,..., 
\end{eqnarray}
and provided $A$ has no non-positive eigenvalues 
this iteration scheme exhibits a quadratic convergence rate with
\begin{equation}
  Y_k \rightarrow A^{1/2}, \:\:\: Z_k \rightarrow A^{-1/2} \:\:\: \mathrm{as} \:\:\:k\rightarrow \infty. 
\end{equation}

\section{Non-Hermitian Many-Body perturbation theory}
\label{sec:multi_reference}
The former section dealt with the problem of 
constructing an energy independent effective two-body interaction 
using similarity transformation methods, generalized to complex
interactions. Having constructed an 
effective interaction in the two-particle model space, this 
interaction is then the basic ingredient in the many-body problem. 
However, dealing with many particles moving in large valence space, 
the dimensionlality may still be of an order not suitable of a
practical solution. The single particle resonances have many 
of the same characteristics as bound states on deformed contours 
in the complex $k$-plane, they are discrete square integrable states
with a set of definite quantum number. Based on this it is reasonable to 
assume that in the many-body problem,  many-body perturbation theory 
orginally developed for bound states, may be generalized to apply for  
many-body resonances. 

The focus in this section will be on the non-Hermitian multi-reference
perturbation theory method (MRPTM), which in the Hermitian case has recently 
been revived in quantum chemistry, see for example Refs.~\cite{multi1,multi2,multi3}. 
The MRPTM differs from standard many-body perturbation techniques, in that
a set of reference states are constructed by diagonalizing $N$-body model-space
Hamiltonian exactly. Having constructed a more suitable basis which 
decouples the $P$-space, this basis serves as starting points for a 
perturbation expansion. It can be shown that this expansion converges
much faster than the single-reference perturbation theory, since many
higher order terms are already incorporated into the zeroth order term.  
The chosen $N$-body model-space $P$ should be of such 
kind that the coupling of $P$ with the complement space $Q$ is weak, for
the perturbation expansion to converge.

For clarity we first outline the standard Many-Body perturbation 
theory where only single references appear. Thereafter we outline 
the multi-reference theory for non-Hermitian interactions, and 
show that even at the first order, MRPTM sums a class
of diagrams to infinite order in appearing in the standard
Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation expansion.
\subsection{Single-Reference perturbation theory.}
Here we outline the standard many-body perturbation theory, 
applicable to the case of many-body resonances. 
Starting with the $N$-body schr\"odinger equation, 
\begin{equation}
  H \Psi = E\Psi 
\end{equation}
where the Hamiltonian is split into an unperturbed 
part $H_0$ for which we can obtain exact solutions, and a
perturbation $V$, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
  H = H_0 + V 
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
  H_0 = \sum_i (T_i + U_i), \:\: V = \sum_{i < j }V_{i,j} -\sum_{i}U_i.  
\end{equation}
The exact solution of $H_0$ are given by,
\begin{equation}
  H_0 \Phi_i = \varepsilon_i \Phi_i, 
\end{equation}
where the $N$-body unperturbed energy $\varepsilon_i $ is given by 
the sum of $N$ single particle energies obtained by 
solving the one-body Hamiltonian, $T + U$, and
$\Phi_i $ is a Slater determinant composed of $N$-particles 
occupying the relevant single-particle orbitals.
Having obtained a complete set of many-body Slater determinants, 
we may define a model space $P$ and complement space $Q$ 
which project into orthogonal parts of the full space,
\begin{equation}
  P = \sum_{i = 1}^{N_P} \vert \Phi_i \rangle \langle \Phi_i^* \vert, \:\:
  Q = \sum_{i = N_P + 1}^{N} \vert \Phi_i \rangle \langle \Phi_i^* \vert.
  \label{eq:pq_op}
\end{equation}
Here $N_P$ is the dimension of the model space and $N$ is the dimension 
of the full space.  
They satisfy the usual equations given in equations~(\ref{eq:P_op}) and 
(\ref{eq:Q_op}). There are many ways of constructing the many-body
$P$- and $Q$-spaces. The most usual is to construct them from the 
single particle model space. So that $P$ is the space constructed from
all single particles occupying orbits in the 
single particle model space  $p$, and $Q$ is the remaining orthogonal space.
The exact $N$-body wave function may then be expanded in this basis, 
\[
\Psi = \sum_{i = 1}^{N_P} C_{i}\Phi_i + \sum_{i = N_P + 1}^N C_i \Phi_i = P\Psi + Q\Psi,
\]
and the full Schr\"odinger equation may be written in the $2\times 2$
block structure given in equation~(\ref{eq:block}). An effective  
eigenvalue problem in the $P$-space may then be otained (see former section),  
\begin{equation}
  \left( P{H}P  +  P{H}Q G(E_k) Q{H}P\right) P \vert \Psi_k \rangle 
  = E_k P \vert \Psi_k \rangle 
  \label{eq:eff1}
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the complete interacting
Green's function in the $Q$-space, 
\begin{equation}
  G(E) = {Q \over E - Q{H} Q } = {Q \over E - H_0 - Q{V} Q }
\end{equation}
Using the operator identity $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}$ 
the interacting Green's function $G(E)$ may be written in the form, neglecting the 
dependence on $E$, 
\begin{equation}
  G = {Q \over 1 - G_0 Q{V} Q } G_0 = G_0 {Q \over 1 -  Q{V} QG_0 },
  \label{eq:green1}
\end{equation}
where the non-interacting Green's function $G_0 $ in the $Q$-space
is given by,
\begin{equation}
  G_0 = {Q \over E - H_0 }.
\end{equation}
By using $ (1-x)^{-1} = 1+ x + x^2 + x^3 +...$ we may write
\begin{equation} 
  {1 \over 1 - Q{V} QG_0 } = 1+ QVQG_0 + (QVQG_0)(QVQG_0)+ (QVQG_0)(QVQG_0)(QVQG_0) + ...,
\end{equation}
which gives for the interacting $Q$-space Green's function 
\begin{equation}
  G = G_0 ( 1+ QVQG_0 + (QVQG_0)(QVQG_0)+ (QVQG_0)(QVQG_0)(QVQG_0) + ...),
\end{equation}
which is just the iterated integral equation for $G(E)$,  
\begin{equation}
  G = G_0 + G_0 QVQ G.
\end{equation}
Inserting the iterated $Q$-space Green's function into the equation for the
effective Hamiltonian given in equation~(\ref{eq:eff1}), we
get the iterated effective interaction, 
\begin{equation}
  V_{\mathrm{eff}} =  PVP + PVQ {1\over E - H_0} Q VP + 
  PVQ {1\over E - H_0} Q V Q {1\over E - H_0} Q VP + ...
  \label{eq:bw1}
\end{equation}
where we have used the fact the operator $Q$ commutes with $H_0$, since 
$P$ and $Q$ are built from the basis which diagonalizes $H_0$. 
The effective interaction given in equation~(\ref{eq:bw1}) still 
depends on the exact energy, which is to be determined. This
problem may be removed by invoking a Taylor expansion in 
$E$ around the unperturbed energies $\varepsilon_a$
of the effective interaction, see Refs.~\cite{mhjensen, osnes} for 
details. In particular it may be shown that only linked diagrams 
contribute in the expansion, giving the Goldstone linked-cluster expansion Ref.~\cite{brandow}.
Due to the cancellation of certain diagrams at each order in the perturbation expansion,
it is possible to do partial infinite summations of the effective interaction. 
One such example of infinite partial summation is the
the ladder equation for the effective interaction, 
\begin{equation}
  V_{\mathrm{eff}} = V + V {Q \over \varepsilon_a - H_0} V_{\mathrm{eff}}.
\end{equation}

Our focus in this subsection is on the single-reference Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger 
perturbation expansion for the energy. Single-reference means that only 
a single model space state is considered, which  gives the projection operators
\begin{equation}
  P = \vert \Phi_a \rangle \langle \Phi_a^*\vert, \:\: 
  Q = \sum_{i \ne a}^N \vert \Phi_i \rangle \langle \Phi_i^*\vert 
\end{equation}
A perturbative treatment of a single model space state, may only
be expected to give convergent results as long as the coupling with 
the $Q$-space is weak. In Gamow Shell Model applications, it
is natural to choose the many-body configuration where all particles
are in resonant orbitals as the reference state, $\vert \Phi_a \rangle = \vert RRR...\rangle $, 
and then add 
perturbations to this state by taking into account all kinds 
excitations to non-resonant continuum states. However, as shown in Paper II 
the coupling with configurations where one or two particles are in 
non-resonant continuum orbits may not be considered weak in most cases.  
By projecting the secular equation for the $P$-space state 
onto the single model space state $\Phi_a $ 
gives the standard Brillouin-Wigner perturbation expansion for the energy, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber
  E = \varepsilon_a + \langle \Phi_a^* \vert 
  PVP + PVQ {1\over E - H_0} Q VP + \\
  PVQ {1\over E - H_0} Q V Q {1\over E - H_0} Q VP + ...\vert \Phi_a \rangle.
\label{eq:bw2}
\end{eqnarray}
In the Brillouin-Wigner perturbation expansion the exact energy in which 
we wish to determine appears from second order and to infinity 
in the energy denominators $E-H_0$. Equation~(\ref{eq:bw2}) may be rewritten 
in such a way that only unperturbed energies appear in the 
denominators, giving the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation expansion. 
Writing the energy denominator in the form, 
\[ 
E-H_0 = \Delta E + \varepsilon_a -H_0 
\]
where $\Delta E$ is the energy shift we wish to determine, we obtain 
the following expression, 
\begin{equation}
  {1\over E- H_0} = {1\over \varepsilon_a -H_0}\left( 1+ { \Delta E\over \varepsilon_a-H_0} \right)^{-1} = 
  {1\over a}\left( 1- {\Delta E\over a} + \left( {\Delta E \over a}\right)^2 
  \: -+ \:...\right),
  \label{eq:delta}
\end{equation}
where we have defined $ a = \varepsilon_a -H_0 $. Inserting equation~(\ref{eq:delta})
into equation~(\ref{eq:bw2}) we get the following equation for the 
energy shift $\Delta E$, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber
  \Delta E = \langle \Phi_a^* \vert 
  PVP + PVQ {1\over a}\left( 1- {\Delta E\over a} + \left( {\Delta E \over a}\right)^2 
  \: -+ \:...\right) Q VP + \\
  \nonumber
  PVQ {1\over a}\left( 1- {\Delta E\over a} + \left( {\Delta E \over a}\right)^2 
  \: -+ \:...\right) Q V Q \times \\
     {1\over a}\left( 1- {\Delta E\over a} + 
     \left( {\Delta E \over a}\right)^2  \: -+ \:...\right) Q VP 
     + ...\vert \Phi_a \rangle.
\end{eqnarray}
Inserting the expression for $\Delta E$ back into itself we get 
order by order correction to the energy by 
sorting the different powers in $V$. It may be shown \cite{brueckner} 
that the $n$'th term in the  Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation expansion 
for the energy is given by the expansion, 
\begin{equation}
  E_n = \langle V S_{n-1} \rangle -\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}E_m\langle S_{n-m}\rangle,
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
  S_n = {Q \over a}VS_{n-1} - {Q\over a} \sum_{m=1}^{n-1}E_mS_{n-m}, \:\: S_0 = 1.
\end{equation}
Here we have introduced the notation 
$\langle V \rangle = \langle \Phi_a ^*\vert V \vert \Phi_a \rangle $. 
By further introducing the quantity $\mathcal{U} = V -\langle V\rangle$, the
perturbation expansion up through fifth order may easily shown to be,
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber E_0 &= &\varepsilon_a = \langle H_0 \rangle, \\
\nonumber E_1 &= &\langle V \rangle, \\
\nonumber E_2 &= &\left\langle V {Q\over a} V \right\rangle, \\
 E_3 &= &\left\langle V {Q\over a} \mathcal{U} {Q\over a} V \right\rangle, \\
\nonumber E_4 &= &\left\langle V {Q\over a} \left[ \mathcal{U} {Q\over a} \mathcal{U} - 
  \left\langle \mathcal{U}{Q\over a}\mathcal U\right\rangle \right] {Q\over a} V \right\rangle, \\
\nonumber E_5 &= &\left\langle V {Q\over a} \left[ \mathcal{U} {Q\over a} \mathcal{U} {Q\over a} \mathcal{U} - 
\left\langle \mathcal{U} {Q\over a} \mathcal{U} {Q\over a} \mathcal{U} \right\rangle -
\mathcal{U} {Q\over a}\left\langle \mathcal{U} {Q\over a} \mathcal{U} \right\rangle -
\left\langle \mathcal{U} {Q\over a} \mathcal{U} \right\rangle{Q\over a} \mathcal{U} \right] 
{Q\over a} V\right \rangle.
\label{eq:rayleigh}
\end{eqnarray}
Here all matrix elements of the form,  
\begin{equation}
  \left \langle {Q\over a} \: \: \mathrm{or}\:\: {Q\over a} \right \rangle  = 0. 
\end{equation}
Since the model space state $\Phi_a $ is 
orthogonal to all states in the complement space $Q$.
The exact energy may  then  be written as a Taylor 
series in the pertubation $\lambda $,
which for $lambda = 1 $ gives the desired result, 
\begin{equation}
  E = \sum_{n=0}^\infty E_n \lambda^n = E_0 + E_1 \lambda + E_2 \lambda^2 +... 
  \label{eq:taylor}
\end{equation}
A more general and effective approximation which 
generally gives a more rapid convergence to the exact energy 
is the Pad\'e approximation \cite{kukulin}. The  Pade approximant 
$E^{[N,M]} $ to the exact energy $E$ is given by the rational fractional 
expression, 
\begin{equation}
  E^{[N,M]}(\lambda )= { P_N(\lambda)\over Q_M(\lambda) },
\end{equation}
where $P_n$ and $Q_M$ are polynomials of degrees $N$ and $M$ respectively.
The polynomials $P_N$ and $Q_M $ may be obtained from the coefficients $E_i$ 
of the Taylor expansion of the exact energy in equation~(\ref{eq:taylor}) 
by the following formulas, 
\begin{equation}
  P_N(\lambda) = 
  \left| \begin{array}{cccc}
    E_{N-M+1} & E_{N-M+2} & \ldots & E_{N+1} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots  \\ 
    E_N & E_{N+1} & \ldots & E_{N+M} \\
    \sum_{j=M}^N E_{j-M}\lambda^j & \sum_{j=M-1}^N E_{j-M+1}\lambda^j & \ldots &
    \ldots  \sum_{j=0}^N E_j \lambda^j 
  \end{array}\right|
 \end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
  Q_M(\lambda) = 
  \left| \begin{array}{cccc}
    E_{N-M+1} & E_{N-M+2} & \ldots & E_{N+1} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots  \\ 
    E_N & E_{N+1} & \ldots & E_{N+M} \\
    \lambda^M & \lambda^{M-1} & \ldots & 1 
    \end{array}\right| 
\end{equation}
The first few Pade approximants take the following form, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber E^{[0,0]} &=& E_0 \\
  \nonumber E^{[1,1]} &=& { E_0 E_1 + ( E_1^2 - E_0E_2)\lambda \over E_1 - E_2\lambda } \\
  \nonumber E^{[2,1]} &=& { E_0E_2 +( E_1E_2 - E_0E_3)\lambda +(E_2^2-E_1E_3)\lambda^2 \over
    E_2 -E_3\lambda } \\
  E^{[1,2]} &=& { (E_0^2 E_2 -E_0E_1^2)+(2E_0E_1E_2-E_0^2E_3-E_1^3)\lambda \over 
    (E_0E_2-E_1^2)+(E_1E_2-E_0E_3)\lambda + (E_1E_3-E_2^2)\lambda^2 } \\
  \nonumber E_{[2,2]} &=& \left[  (E_0E_1E_3-E_0E_2^2) + (E_1^2E_3+E_0E_2E_3-E_0E_2E_3-E_0E_1E_4-E_1E_2^2)\lambda \right.\\  
  \nonumber & + & \left.    ( E_1E_2E_3+E_0E_2E_4+E_1E_2E_3-E_1^2E_4 -E_2^3-E_0E_3^2) \lambda^2 \right] / \\
  \nonumber & & ( E_1E_3-E_2^2) + (E_2E_3-E_1E_4)\lambda +(E_2E_4-E_3^2)\lambda^2 
\end{eqnarray}

In order to clarify the use of single-reference perturbation 
theory in Gamow Shell Model calculations, we consider the 
convergence of the Pade approximant $E^{[2,1]}$ versus the 
standard energy expansion up through third order in energy, to the
$0^+$ ground state of $^6$He as the residual 
nucleon-nucleon interaction is gradually turned on. $^6$He is here modeled
by an inert $^4$He core with two valence nucleons moving in 24 $lj$
orbits $p_{3/2}$, where one is a single particle 
resonant orbit and the remaining 23 orbits are in the non-resonant continuum.
See Paper II for further details on the single particle potential and the
residual nucleon-nucleon interaction.  The two-particle single model space state
is then the configuration where both particles are in resonant orbits, $\vert RR \rangle $, 
and the complement space is then all configurations of the type ${\vert RC \rangle, \vert CC \rangle}$,
where $C$ labels a non-resonant continuum orbit.
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{9cm}{7cm}{\epsfig{file=figures/pade_re.eps}}
\end{center}
\caption{Plot of real part of $0^+$ energy in $^6$He, for 
increasing interaction strength $V_0$. Solid line gives the exact energy, 
the dashed line gives the series expansion of the energy up through third
order and the dashed-dotted line gives the  $E^{[2,1]}$ Pade
approximation to the energy.} 
\label{fig:pade1}
\end{figure} 
Figure~\ref{fig:pade1} gives the real part of the $0^+$ energy, while 
figure~\ref{fig:pade2} gives the corresponding imaginary part of the energy, as the
interaction strength is gradually turned on. In both cases it is seen 
that the Pade approximant $E^{[2,1]}$ gives a better fit to the exact energy, than 
the Taylor expansion up through third order. In both cases the single-reference
perturbation theory fails to give satisfactory result for the energy when 
the interaction strength is that of Paper II, i.e. $V_0 = -5.315$MeV.  
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{9cm}{7cm}{\epsfig{file=figures/pade_im.eps}}
\end{center}
\caption{Plot of imaginary part of $0^+$ energy in $^6$He, for

the dashed line gives the series expansion of the energy up through third
order and the dashed-dotted line gives the  $E^{[2,1]}$ Pade
approximation to the energy.} 
\label{fig:pade2}
\end{figure} 
It is also seen that single-reference perturbation theory 
gives convergent results in this specific case only 
for interaction strengths less than $1$MeV. One may therefore
conclude that single-reference perturbation theory, is not
suitable in Gamow Shell Model calculations, since the coupling
with the complement space is too strong, for being treated perturbatively.

\subsection{Multi-reference perturbation theory.}
In this section we outline the non-Hermitian multi-reference perturbation theory.
We proceed in similar manner as in the previous section, and 
construct a $N$-body model space $P$ and 
a complement (orthogonal) space $Q$ according to equation~(\ref{eq:pq_op}). 
The choice of $P$ should 
be dictacted by some intuition on which single particle configurations 
play the dominant part in the fully correlated many-body wave function.
Having constructed $P$ and $Q$ the many-body wave function and the 
corresponding Hamiltonian may be represented in this basis. The Hamiltonian may 
subsequently be partioned into two parts according to, 
\begin{equation} 
  \left( \begin{array}{cc}
    PHP & PHQ \\ 
    QHP & QHQ  
  \end{array} \right)  =  
  \left( \begin{array}{cc}
    H^{PP} & 0 \\ 
    0 & H^{QQ}
  \end{array} \right) 
  +
  \left( \begin{array}{cc}
    0 & H^{PQ} \\ 
    H^{QP} & \tilde{H}^{QQ}  
  \end{array} \right) =  H_0 + H_1.
\end{equation}
Here $ D^{QQ} $ is the diagonal part and $\tilde{H}^{QQ} $ the off-diagonal part of $QHQ $ 
respectively. 
Written in this form, it is seen that $H^0$ defines the unperturbed part while $H^1$ gives the 
perturbations to $H^0$.  
Provided $H^0$ is non-singular, the model space block $PHP$ may be decoupled by   
constructing a complex orthogonal matrix $ {\bf C }  $ 
which diagonalizes  $H^0$, i.e. 
$ {\bf C}  H^0 {\bf C}^T = Diag(E^0_1, E_2^0,...,E_N^0) $. 
Since $H^0$ is  a block diagonal matrix, the matrix $ {\bf C }  $ is given in the form
\begin{equation}
  {\bf C} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 
      {\bf \chi } & {\bf 0} \\
	{\bf 0 }& {\bf 1 } 
    \end{array} \right]
\end{equation}
A more convienient many-body basis 
which decouples (diagonalizes) the reference space is then given by
\begin{equation}
  \Upsilon_i = \sum_{j=1}^N C_{i,j}\Phi_j = 
  \left\{ \begin{array}{c} \sum_{j=1}^{N_P}\chi_{i,j}\Phi_j ,\:\:  i = 1,N_P \\
    \Phi_i, \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: i = N_P + 1, N 
  \end{array}\right. 
\end{equation}
and they are solutions of the eigenvalue problem,
\begin{equation}
  H_0  \vert \Upsilon_i \rangle = \tilde{\varepsilon}_i \vert \Upsilon_i \rangle.
\end{equation}
We assume here that the states $ \vert \Upsilon_i \rangle $ are normalized to unity.
The complex orthogonal matrix ${\bf \chi }$ which span the reference space $P$, 
defines our new set of reference states.  
The states $\Upsilon_i,\: i = 1,...,N_P $ span the same space as
the original $P$-space states $\Phi_i$, but they have been reoriented in space
so that they diagonalize $PHP$.  
As a measure of how well the zeroth order wave 
function $\Upsilon_{i=\mathrm{res}}^J$ 
resembles the exact  wave function, one can calculate the complex variance 
$\sigma_c^2 $ see Refs.~\cite{nimrod,davidson3},
\begin{eqnarray} 
  \nonumber
  \sigma_c^2 & = & { \langle {\Upsilon_{i}^J}^* \vert 
    \left( H - E_{i}^0 \right)^2 \vert {\Upsilon}_{i}^J \rangle } \\
  & = & \chi^T_i H^{PQ}H^{QP} \chi_i, 
\end{eqnarray}  
where $i= \mathrm{res}$ and $ \chi_i $ labels the $i$'th column of the $N_P\times N_P$  matrix $\chi $. 
In Ref.~\cite{davidson3}  it was proved that 
the complex variance $\sigma_c $ provides an upper bound to the exact resonance energy, 
\begin{equation}
  \left| E^{\mathrm{exact}}_{\mathrm{res}} - E_{\mathrm{res}}^0 \right| \leq \left| \sigma_c \right|
\end{equation} 
Having constructed a new many-body anti-symmetric basis, we develop 
a perturbation expansion in terms of these eigenvectors of the 
reference space. Derivation of the Rayleigh - Schr\"odinger perturbation
expansion for the exact energy and wave function follows in exactly the same manner
as in previous section. We wish to study how a single reference state $\Upsilon_i $ 
changes order by order in the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation
expansion by adding the perturbation matrix $H^1$. So the 
$P$-space is a single state and the orthogonal complement is the remaining states
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{P} = \vert \Upsilon_a \rangle\langle \Upsilon_a^*\vert , \:\:
  \tilde{Q} = \sum_{i\ne a}\vert \Upsilon_i \rangle\langle \Upsilon_i^*\vert.
\end{equation}
Consider the 1'st order correction to the energy
for any state $\Upsilon_p$ in the model space, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  E_1(p)  = \langle \Upsilon_p^* \vert H_1 \vert \Upsilon_p \rangle = 
  \left( \begin{array}{cc} \chi_p^{\mathrm{T}} &  0 \end{array}\right) 
  \left( \begin{array}{cc} 
    0 & H^{PQ} \\
    H^{QP} & H^{QQ} \end{array}\right) 
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
    \chi_p \\
    0 \end{array}\right)  = 0, 
\end{equation}
which gives zero contribution. This is an extremely nice feature, since
all expansion terms where 1'st order matrix elements $E_1$ appear in a product 
with more complicated terms give zero contribution. The 1'st order correction to the 
energy may be said to have been incorporated into the zeroth order energy 
$\tilde{\varepsilon}_i$.
The second order correction to an unperturbed energy $\tilde{\varepsilon}_p$
becomes
\begin{equation} 
E_2(p) =  \sum_{a\ne p}^N  {  \langle \Upsilon_p^* \vert H_1 
 \vert \Upsilon_a \rangle \langle \Upsilon_a^*\vert H_1 \vert \Upsilon_p \rangle 
\over \tilde{\varepsilon}_p -\tilde{\varepsilon}_a }
\end{equation}
from the structure of the perturbation matrix $H^1$ is easily seen that the sum over
$Q$-space states is restricted to $ a > N_P $ by taken into the account 
$ \langle \Upsilon_i^* \vert H_1 \vert \Upsilon_j \rangle = 0 ,\:\: i,j \leq N_P$.
This illustrates that many  excitations from the $P$- into the $Q$-space have
already been taken into account in the zeroth order wave function.
The second order energy term then becomes, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
  \nonumber E_2(p)&  = &   \sum_{a > N_P}^N  { \langle \Upsilon_p^* \vert H_1
    \vert \Upsilon_a \rangle \langle \Upsilon_a^*\vert 
H_1 \vert \Upsilon_p \rangle \over \tilde{\varepsilon}_p -\tilde{\varepsilon}_a }=
\sum_{i,j \le N_P } \sum_{a> N_P} { \chi_{p,i}
    \langle \Phi_i^*\vert H_1 \vert \Phi_a \rangle \langle \Phi_a^*\vert H_1 \vert \Phi_j\rangle \chi_{j,p} 
    \over  \tilde{\varepsilon}_p -\tilde{\varepsilon}_a }  \\
& = & \sum_{i,j \le N_P } \sum_{a> N_P} { \chi_{p,i}
  H^{PQ}_{i,a} H^{QP}_{a,j}\chi_{j,p} 
    \over  \tilde{\varepsilon}_p - D^{QQ}_{a,a} }. 
\end{eqnarray}
and the third order term becomes 
\begin{equation}
  E_3(p) =  \sum_{ \stackrel{a,b > N_P}{a \ne b}} ^N   { \langle \Upsilon_p^* \vert H_1 
  \vert \Upsilon_a \rangle \langle \Upsilon_b^* \vert H_1 \vert \Upsilon_p \rangle \over
  ( \tilde{\varepsilon}_p -\tilde{\varepsilon}_a) 
  ( \tilde{\varepsilon}_p -\tilde{\varepsilon}_b ) } 
  = \sum_{i,j \le N_P} \sum_{\stackrel{a,b > N_P}{a \ne b}} { \chi_{p,i} H^{PQ}_{i,a}\tilde{H}^{QQ}_{a,b}H^{QP}_{b,j}\chi_{j,p}
    \over   ( \tilde{\varepsilon}_p - D^{QQ}_{a,a}) 
    ( \tilde{\varepsilon}_p -D^{QQ}_{b,b} ) }. 
  \end{equation}
Higher order terms may easily calculated from the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation
expansion given in equation(\ref{eq:rayleigh}).
Summarizing we get through fourth order, 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber E_0(p) &=& \langle \Upsilon_p^*\vert H^0 \vert \Upsilon_p \rangle = \tilde{\varepsilon}_p, \\
  \nonumber E_1(p) &=& \langle \Upsilon_p^*\vert H^1 \vert \Upsilon_p \rangle = 0, \\ 
  \nonumber E_2(p) &=& \langle \Upsilon_p^*\vert H^1 {Q\over \tilde{\varepsilon}_p - H^0} 
  H^1 \vert \Upsilon_p \rangle, \\
  E_3(p) &=& \langle \Upsilon_p^*\vert H^1 {Q\over \tilde{\varepsilon}_p - H^0} 
  H^1 {Q\over \tilde{\varepsilon}_p - H^0} H^1 \vert \Upsilon_p \rangle, \\
  \nonumber E_4(p) &=& \langle \Upsilon_p^*\vert H^1 {Q\over \tilde{\varepsilon}_p - H^0} 
  H^1 {Q\over \tilde{\varepsilon}_p - H^0} H^1 
  {Q\over \tilde{\varepsilon}_p - H^0} H^1 \vert \Upsilon_p \rangle \\
  \nonumber &-& E_2(p)\langle \Upsilon_p^* \vert H^1 {Q\over (\tilde{\varepsilon}_p - H^0)^2} 
  H^1 \vert \Upsilon_p \rangle. 
\end{eqnarray} 
Where $ Q = \sum_{i > N_P} \vert \Upsilon_i \rangle \langle \Upsilon_i ^*\vert $.

The above perturbation series is a theory which treats one-state-at-a-time, 
this theory differs from the standard multi-reference perturbation
theory which diagonalizes an effective Hamiltonian and solves for all 
states in the model space simultaneously. The above perturbation theory 
sets no restrictions on the choice of many-body reference space, and
can in principle be chosen by any suitable selection criterion. The 
theory also allows for a freely variation of the reference space size,
so that it is possible to achieve satisfactory convergent results 
at a given order in  the perturbation series. If the coupling between the 
reference states is turned off, the perturbation series reduces to the
standard single-reference Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory 
discussed in the previous section.

In the application of the above multi-reference perturbation theory 
method to Gamow Shell Model calculations, a reference space which 
takes into account most of the correlations has to be chosen. 
Further the size of the $P$-space should be small enough to allow
for a direct diagonalization in order to obtain the reference states 
$\Upsilon_i, \:\: i = 1,...,N_P$. The most important configuration in
a many-body resonance may be expected to be the pure resonance 
pole configuration  $\vert RRR...\rangle $. We wish then to 
generate correlations on this unperturbed many-body resonance 
state, in order to obtain the fully correlated many-body resonance.
The correlations are generated by virtual excitations of one or several
particles occupying the single particle resonant orbitals to non-resonant continuum 
orbitals, induced by the residual nucleon-nucleon interaction.
A viable starting point for Gamow Shell Model applications, would be
to construct a reference space $ P $ conisisting of a set of low lying 
many-body unperturbed states where at least one particle is in a single 
particle resonance orbital. The orthogonal complement  space $Q$ 
consits then of the remaining states. 
In Paper II where the above perturbation theory where applied to 
the unbound nucleus $^7$He, 
the three-particle model space, and corresponding complement space, 
where defined by
\begin{eqnarray}
  P \equiv 
  \left\{ \begin{array}{c} \vert RRR \rangle, \vert RRC\rangle, \vert RCC\rangle ,\\
    \mathrm{Re}(e_a+e_b+e_c) <  E_{\mathrm{cut}}, \\
    \mathrm{Im}(e_a+e_b+e_c) > -E_{\mathrm{cut}}
  \end{array} \right\}\:\:\: Q = 1-P,
  \label{eq:mspace1}
\end{eqnarray}
here the $P$ space is given by configurations where at most two 
particles move in continuum orbits. In addition, $P$ is further defined by a
rectangular cutoff in the complex energy plane. This cutoff in energy is motivated by 
an assumption that three-particle configurations high in 
energy play a minor role on the formation of low-lying resonances.
Figure~\ref{fig:P_space_ch1} gives a plot of the $J^\pi = {3/2}^-$ 
unperturbed (non-interacting) 
three-particle spectrum of $^7$He used in Paper II.  
At most two particles move in complex continuum orbits, 
and three different cut-offs in energies and corresponding model spaces are shown. 
Note that only $p_{3/2} $ single particle orbitals are taken into account.

\caption{Three choices of the model space used in the multi-configuration 
perturbation method. The three-particle model space states are constructed
such that at most two particles move in the non-resonant continuum.} 
\label{fig:P_space_ch1}
\end{figure} 
Having constructed a suitable model space $P$, a full diagonalization
is performed. We wish to study the effect of adding the perturbation $H^1 $
to the new many-body resonance wave function. Since the above theory 
is one-state-at-a-time theory, the zeroth order resonance $ \Upsilon (i=res) $
has to be identified from the zeroth order energy spectrum.  This identification may 
may be done by determining which state $ \Upsilon_i, \:\: i = 1, ...,N_P $ has the 
largest overlap with the pure pole configuration 
$\vert \Phi_{\mathrm{res}}\rangle  = \vert RRR... \rangle $,
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Max} \left\{ \left| \langle  \tilde{\Phi}(\mathrm{res}) \vert 
  \Upsilon_i  \rangle \right| \right\}_{i=1}^{N_P}=
  \mathrm{Max} \left\{ \left| \chi_{i,j={\mathrm{res}} } \right| \right\}_{i=1}^{N_P}
  \label{eq:overlap}
\end{equation}
To make sure the ``correct'' physical state is picked out, the
complex energy trajectories as the interaction is gradually turned on may 
be studied.

\section{Effective interaction scheme for Gamow shell model calculations}
\label{sec:effective_scheme}

In the previous sections it was shown that the Lee-Suzuki similarity transformation 
and the multi-reference perturbation method may be used in the Gamow shell model 
in order to  account for the most important correlations of for example a  multi-particle resonance. 
Although the dimensionality of the problem derived either 
from the similarity transformation method or the multi-reference perturbation method 
was significantly reduced compared to the full problem, the dimensionality may still be a severe
problem when dealing with more than three particles in a big valence space. 

The drawback of the multi-reference perturbation method is that one has to store 
extremely large matrices $H^{QQ}$ 
if one wishes to go beyond second order in perturbation theory. In the similarity 
transformation method one does not have to deal with $H^{QQ}$, as couplings with
the $Q$-space states have been dealt with, in practical calculations at least at the two-body level. 
Going to systems with larger degrees of freedom, the $P$-space may nevertheless,
at the converged level, be too large for our brute force diagonalization approach.

The aim of this section is to propose an effective interaction and perturbation theory scheme 
for the Gamow shell model. This approach 
combines the similarity transformation method and the multi-reference perturbation method,
so that hopefully multi-particle resonances where several particles move 
in large valence spaces, may be calculated without a diagonalization in the full space.
Our algorithm is as follows
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose an optimal set of $n_{sp}$ single-particle orbits, which in turn defines 
two-body  $P_{2p}$ and  many-body spaces. In our case  these single-particle orbits are defined by 
selected states in $^5$He.
\item Construct a two-particle effective interaction by the Lee-Suzuki similarity transformation method
  within the two-particle model space $P_{2p}$. Such diagonalizations can be done for very large spaces,
see for example Refs.~\cite{bruce1,bruce2,bruce3,bruce4}.
\item The next step is to divide the multi-particle model space $P$ in two smaller spaces $P'$ and $Q'$, 
  where $P=P'+Q'$ and $ N_P = N_{P'} +N_{Q'}  $. 
  The choice of $P'$ should be dictated by our knowledge of the physical system. As an example, 
one may consider those single-particle configurations within the $P-$space that play 
the dominant role in the formation of 
  the multi-particle resonance.  The number $N_P = N_{P'} + N_{Q'}$ represents the total number of 
  many-body configurations within the $P-$space.
\item Now that we have divided the $P$-space in two sub-spaces $P'$ and $Q'$, we use for example 
  the multi-reference perturbation method  to account for 
  excitations from the $P'-$ space to the $Q'-$ space to obtain energy corrections to a specific order.
  Increase the size of the $P'-$space until convergence is obtained. In the case $N_{P'} = N_P $ and 
  $N_{Q'} = N_P-N_{P'} = 0$ the multi-reference perturbation expansion terminates at zeroth order,
  and corresponds to a full diagonalization within the $P-$space. 
  Another option is to use for example the coupled cluster method as exposed in Refs.~\cite{cc1,cc2}. 
\item Start from top again with a larger set of single-particle orbits, 
  and continue until a  convergence criterion is reached.
\end{enumerate}
We illustrate these various choices of model spaces in the following two figures.
figure~\ref{fig:paulioperator} defines our model space for the Lee-Suzuki similarity transformation
at the two-body level. This corresponds to steps one and two in the above algorithm.
The set of single-particle orbits defines the last single-particle orbit in the model space $n_{sp}$. 
Note that we could have chosen a model space defined by a cut in  energy, as done by the No-Core
collaboration, see for example Refs.~\cite{bruce1,bruce2,bruce3,bruce4}. These examples serve just to 
illustrate the algorithm.

Figure~\ref{fig:finalp} demonstrates again a possible division of the three- and many particle space 
into the full model space
$P$ and a smaller space ${P'}$. Again, this 
figure serves only the purpose of illustrating the method.
In our actual calculations we define the smaller space ${P'}$ via an energy cut in the real and 
imaginary eigenvalues and selected many-body configurations.
 
In summary, defining a set of single-particle orbits in order to construct the two-body and many-body 
model spaces, we obtain first an effective two-body interaction in the  space $P_{2p}$
by performing the 
Lee-Suzuki \cite{suzuki1,suzuki2,suzuki3,suzuki4} transformation. This interaction and the 
pertinent single-particle orbits are then used to define a large many-body space. 
It is therefore of interest to see if we can reduce this dimensionality through the definition of smaller
spaces and perturbative corrections. 

\section{Inclusion of realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions in Gamow
  shell model calculations}
\label{sec:realistic_interactions}
In microscopic nuclear many-body calculations, the strong 
short range repulsion in realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions 
complicates the calculations considerably since the repulsive core 
makes a perturbative treatment unsuitable. Therefore we wish
to construct a renormalized interaction in a  model space, which 
smoothes out the repulsive core of the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction.
Typically, the renormalized nucleon-nucleon interaction has been constructed
from the Brueckner G-matrix approach (see Ref.~\cite{mhjensen}). The G-matrix 
is a soft interaction, which is obtained by resumming in-medium particle-particle
scattering. The renormalized G-matrix is both energy- and nucleus dependent, which 
makes it difficult to extend the G-matrix to drip line nuclei.
Recently, an alternative approach, to the renormalized G-matrix,
which integrates out the high momentum components of the nucleon-nucleon
interactions has been proposed \cite{bogner,fujii,fujii2,nogga}. 
Using a similarity transformation of the two-nucleon Hamiltonian,
a Hermitian soft-core effective nucleon-nucleon interaction is obtained
in a model model space defined by a cutoff $\Lambda  $ in relative momentum
between the nucleons. This effective interaction has become known, as
a low-momentum nucleon-nucleon (LMNN) interaction, $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$. 
The $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ is an energy and nucleus indepedent effective interaction, 
which depends only the model space cutoff $\Lambda $ and the 
bare nucleon-nucleon interaction. 
The effective low-momentum interaction ($V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$)
is constructed in such a way that it reproduces 
exactly the main characteristics of the 
nucleon-nucleon wave function in the full space. 
The $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ is a promising approach for 
nuclei along the drip lines. 

In this section, we show that it is possible 
to obtain a $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ in the complex $k$-plane, 
starting with the momentum space Schr\"odinger equation 
defined on an inversion symmetric contour $L^+$. As an illustration we construct 
a $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ on a purely rotated contour using the realistic CD-Bonn 
nucleon-nucleon interaction \cite{machleidt}. The effective interaction 
may then be the basic input in microscopic calculations of many-body 
resonances. In the following we outline the procedure for obtaining a complex symmetric
$V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$, based on the Lee-Suzuki similarity transformation for complex
interactions (see Section~\ref{sec:lee_suzuki}) and the Contour Deformation Method 
(see Section~\ref{sec:analytic_continuation}).
Starting with the transformed momentum space Schr\"odinger equation, 
\begin{equation}
  \int_{L^+}dk'\:{k'}^2 \langle k^*\vert T + V \vert k'\rangle \langle {k'}^*\vert \psi_{n}\rangle
  = E_{n} \langle k^*\vert \psi_{n}\rangle. 
\end{equation}
where the plane wave states are eigenfunctions of the kinetic energy 
operator and they form a complete set 
\begin{equation}
  \int_{L^+} dk \:k^2 \vert k\rangle \langle k^*\vert. 
\end{equation}
The momentum space Schr\"odinger equation is solved as a matrix equation
by discretizing the integration contour $L^+$ by some suitable 
quadrature rule, e.g. Gauss-Legendre quadrature. The discretized Schr\"odinger equation
becomes on the chosen contour 
\begin{equation}
  \sum_j w_j k_j^2 \langle k_i^*\vert T+V\vert k_j \rangle \langle k_j^*\vert\psi_{n}\rangle 
  =  E_{n} \langle k_i^*\vert \psi_{n}\rangle. 
  \label{eq:vlowk1}
\end{equation}
Here $k_i$ are the integration points and $w_i$ the corresponding quadrature weights.
Introducing the modified plane wave kets
$\vert \bar{k_i} \rangle = k_i\sqrt{w_i} \vert k_i \rangle $, equation~(\ref{eq:vlowk1}) 
becomes
\begin{equation}
  \sum_j  \langle \bar{k_i}^*\vert T+V \vert \bar{k_j} \rangle 
  \langle \bar{k_j}^*\vert\psi_{n}\rangle 
  =  E_{n} \langle \bar{k_i}^*\vert\psi_{n}\rangle. 
  \label{eq:vlowk2}
\end{equation}
where we have 
\begin{equation}
  1 = \sum_{i=1}^N \vert \bar{k_i} \rangle\langle \bar{k_i}^*\vert, \:\:
  \langle \bar{k_i}^*\vert \bar{k_j} \rangle = \delta_{i,j}.
\end{equation}
The matrix elements of the Hamiltonian becomes in the plane wave basis
\begin{equation}
  H_{i,j} = \langle \bar{k_i}^*\vert T+V \vert \bar{k_j} \rangle  = 
  {k_i^2\over 2\mu}\delta_{i,j} + \sqrt{w_iw_j}k_ik_j V_l(k_i,k_j).
\end{equation} 
The full space is now divided in a model space $P$ and an orthogonal complement 
space $Q$. The model space $P$ consits of the $N_P$  plane wave states
lying below some cutoff $\Lambda $ in momentum, and the $Q$-space
consists of the remaining states, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  P = \left\{ \vert \bar{k_p}\rangle, \:\: \vert k\vert  \leq \Lambda \right\}, \:\:
  Q = \left\{ \vert \bar{k_q}\rangle, \:\: \Lambda < \vert k\vert < \infty \right\}.
\end{equation}
In order to obtain an effective interaction in the model space $P$,
the decoupling condition in equation~(\ref{eq:decoup}) 
has to be fulfilled and we have to solve
for the transformation operator $\omega$ in equation~(\ref{eq:omega}).
Given the transformation matrix $\omega $ in the plane wave basis
$ \langle \bar{k}^*_q \vert \: \omega \: \vert \bar{k}_p \rangle $, the
low-momentum effective nucleon-nucleon interaction $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$, 
of the Okubo form (equation~(\ref{eq:okubo})) is given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber \langle \bar{k_p}^*\vert V_{\mathrm{low-k}} \vert \bar{k_p}'\rangle & = & 
  \sum_{k_p''}\sum_{k_p'''}
  \langle \bar{k_p}^* \vert (P+\omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega )^{1/2} \vert \bar{k_p}'' \rangle
  \langle \bar{k_p}''^* \vert H_{LS} \vert \bar{k_p}'''\rangle 
  \langle \bar{k_p}'''^*\vert  (P+\omega^{\mathrm{T}}\omega )^{-1/2} \vert \bar{k_p}'\rangle \\
  & - & {k_p^2\over 2\mu} \delta_{k_p,k_p'},
\end{eqnarray} 
see Section~\ref{sec:lee_suzuki} for further details. The effective interaction 
in the original plane wave basis $\vert k_i \rangle $ is then given by 
\begin{equation}
  \nonumber \langle {k_i}^*\vert V_{\mathrm{low-k}} \vert {k_j}'\rangle  =  
  { \nonumber \langle \bar{k_i}^*\vert V_{\mathrm{low-k}} \vert \bar{k_j}'\rangle 
    \over \sqrt{w_iw_j} k_ik_j },
\end{equation}
where $\left\{ \vert k_i\rangle, \:\vert k_j \rangle\right\}  \in P$.

The aim is to obtain a realistic effective nucleon-nucleon interaction, 
which is applicable in microscopic calculations of many-body 
resonances, which takes the continuum properly into account.
As discussed in detail in the previous sections, the nucleon-nucleon
interaction has to be analytically continued onto the second 
energy sheet, in order to obtain resonances in the calculated spectrum.
From a CDM perspective, 
we wish then to obtain a low-momentum nucleon-nucleon interaction, $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$,
on an inversion symmetric contour in the complex $k$-plane. Here we 
illustrate how this may be achieved for the realistic CD-Bonn \cite{machleidt} 
interaction. A constraint on the theory, is that all low-energy characteristics
of the nucleon-nucleon system are conserved. We consider a contour $L^+$ of 
the simplest kind, which is just a purely rotated contour in the $k$-plane.
See figure~\ref{fig:contour1} for an illustration of the contour.

\emph{inversion symmetric}. The two body spectrum which is exposed by this contour is marked by 
filled circles $ \bullet $ and the excluded spectrum by open circles $\circ $.
 The full spectrum includes bound states (B), 
antibound (A), decay (D) and capture (C) resonant states.}

\caption{Plot of the real  part  of the

\label{fig:vlowk1}
\end{figure}
The momentum space Schr\"odinger equation for the low momentum nucleon-nucleon
interaction becomes on the rotated contour $L^+_\Lambda \equiv \exp(-i\theta) \vert k\vert, \:
\vert k \vert \leq \Lambda$, 
\begin{equation}
  \int_{0}^{\vert k'\vert = \Lambda} d k' \: {k'}^2 \langle k^*\vert T + V_{\mathrm{low-k}} 
  \vert k'\rangle \langle {k'}^*\vert \psi_{n}\rangle
  = E_{n} \langle k^*\vert \psi_{n}\rangle, 
\end{equation}
with $k= \exp(-i\theta)\vert k \vert $. Discretizing the contour defined from 
$ \vert k \vert = 0$ to $\vert k\vert = \Lambda$, the matrix 
equation is obtained 
\begin{equation}
  \sum_j  \langle \bar{k_i}^*\vert T+V_{\mathrm{low-k}} \vert \bar{k_j} \rangle 
  \langle \bar{k_j}^*\vert\psi_{n}\rangle 
  =  E_{n} \langle \bar{k_i}^*\vert\psi_{n}\rangle. 
  \label{eq:vlowk3}
\end{equation}
with the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian given by
\begin{equation}
  H_{i,j} = \langle \bar{k_i}^*\vert T+V_{\mathrm{low-k}} \vert \bar{k_j} \rangle  = 
  {k_i^2\over 2\mu}\delta_{i,j} + \sqrt{w_iw_j}k_ik_j V_{\mathrm{low-k}}(k_i,k_j).
\end{equation} 
A two-dimensional interpolation routine is used 
in order to obtain $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ at arbitrary points on the 
contour $L^+_\Lambda$.
Figure~\ref{fig:vlowk1} gives a plot of the diagonal part of
the  $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ ( dashed line )
interaction and the original CD-Bonn (solid line) nucleon-nucleon interaction 
for the deuteron channel $^3S_1-^3D_1$, for the non-scaled case ($\theta = 0$).
In Refs.~\cite{fujii,bogner} it was shown that the binding energy of the deuteron 
and the scattering phase shifts below $E_{\mathrm{lab}} < 300 $MeV 
using $V_{\mathrm{low-k}} $ for a model space cutoff $\Lambda = 2 \mathrm{fm}^{-1}$,
reproduce exactly the ones obtained from the original nucleon-nucleon interaction. 
This is only to be expected since a similarity transformation of the
Hamiltonian does not change the energies. 
However, it was shown in Ref.~\cite{fujii} the $D$-state probability of the deuteron
is not reproduced for momentum cutoffs smaller than $ \Lambda \sim 4-5\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$, 
see also table~\ref{tab:vlowk1} for the non-scaled case $\theta =0$.
The exact value of the $D$-state probability is retained for these values of $\Lambda$, 
by using the corresponding 
similarity transformed projection operator onto the $D$-state. 
In Ref.~\cite{fujii} the application of $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ in 
calculation of the binding energy of the nuclei $^3 \mathrm{H}, ^4$He and 
$^{16}$O 
where studied. It was found, in comparison with exact calculations 
using the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction, that a satisfactory convergence 
for the binding energies where obtained for a momentum cutoff 
$ \lambda \geq 5\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$. In addition  the convergence
of the single particle energies in $^{16}$O where studied,
and also here a satisfactory convergence where obtained for 
$\Lambda \geq 5\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$. 

In table~\ref{tab:vlowk1} we show results for the deuteron binding energy and 
the $D$-state probability for different cutoffs $\Lambda $, 
for the non-scaled case ($\theta = 0$) and the complex scaled case $(\theta = \pi/6$).
The deuteron binding energy is reproduced for all cutoffs, as expected. 
It is seen that the $D$-state probability, for the non-scaled case ($\theta = 0$), 
decreases monotonically for smaller and smaller cutoff $\Lambda$. 
The $D-state$ probability saturates at the exact value for a 
cutoff $ \Lambda \sim 5\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$, this is consistent with the findings
in Refs.~\cite{fujii,fujii2,nogga} where the ground state energy of the considered 
nuclei $^3 \mathrm{H}, ^4$He and $^{16}$O are converged for a cutoff 
$\Lambda \geq 5\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$. 

It is also seen for the complex scaled case ($\theta = \pi/6$)
that the deuteron binding energy is reproduced at all values 
of $\Lambda$. Further it is observed that 
the $D$-state probability saturates at the exact value 
even slower than in the non-scaled case. It is seen that for 
$\lambda < 5 \mathrm{fm}^{-1}$ the $D$-state probability 
aquires in addition to the real part, a considerable imaginary part.
In this case a satisfactory converged $D$-state probability is obtained 
for a cutoff $\Lambda \geq 7 \mathrm{fm}^{-1}$.  This gives an indication
of the cutoff $\Lambda $ required to give converged results in nuclear 
structure calculations, using complex scaled low-momentum nucleon-nucleon  
interactions.

which imply that the imaginary part

momenta $k$. The unphysical imaginary part which occur for the $D$-state probability at 
$\Lambda = 2\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$  may therefore traced back to the non-zero imaginary part of
$V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ at $k=0 \mathrm{fm}^{-1}$.

using a cutoff $\Lambda = 7\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$. In this case it is seen that the imaginary part
of $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ is approaching zero for $k \rightarrow 0\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$. This imply 
that there is no imaginary part in $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ except for the complex scaled
momenta $k$. By considering the  $D$-state probability at 
$\Lambda = 7\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$  we also observe that the exact $D$-state probability is 
reproduced in this case. The cutoff $\Lambda $ at which $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ has 
this property is ofcourse dependent on the complex scaling angle $\theta$. 
For $\theta \rightarrow 0$ the results for the non-scaled $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ is 
retained. One may conclude from this survey of the properties of 
complex scaled low-momentum nucleon-nucleon interactions, that one must 
be careful in choosing a model space cutoff $\Lambda $ when applying 
$V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$ in microscopic nuclear structure calculations. 
However, ther present study is a promising approach for study of resonant
structures in nuclear many-body systems, 
starting with realistically derived nucleon-nucleon interactions.
The first application, which is under preparation, is to calculate 
self consistently Hartree-Fock single-particle energies of loosely bound
nuclei using a complex scaled $V_{\mathrm{low-k}}$. This approach, allows 
for a self-consistent treatment of both single-particle bound states and 
single-particle resonant states.
