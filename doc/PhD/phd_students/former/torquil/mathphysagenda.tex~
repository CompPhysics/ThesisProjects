\title{A study of the physics and mathematics behind Bose-Einstein condensate.}
 
\begin{document}

\maketitle

A Bose-Einstein condensate
is obtained by shooting at the high energy particles in an atomic Bose gas with a laser and thereby removing them.
The condensate has several desirable properties such as superfluidity and superconductance and therefore a  high
potential for a wide array of ``big'' applications. 

While a simple description is available when $T=0$ 
it is a fact that getting there one must start at some positive $T>0$.  From a practical point of view it is of great importance that
this process goes as smoothly, controlled, and predictable as possible in order to open up for possible technical
applications. In achieving this a thorough, qualitative, and quantifiable understanding of the phenomena is needed.

From physical experiments it has been observed that many    interesting phenomena occur while cooling the Bose gas.
In the condensate phase it may form vortice's (referred to as ``quantum turbulence'') 
at some excited states and of course there is the phase
transition for  higher temperatures. It is therefore reasonable to assume any mathematical description of the evolution
of such a system, as the temperature drops, to be rich enough and have an intriguing mathematical strtucture well
worth of a serios mathematical undertaking. 

The dynamics of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate is assumed to be more or less 
properly described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. This is a Schr\"odinger equation with nonlinearities of third order.

In a series of well cited papers \cite{G1}-\cite{G6} Gardiner et.al  have developed a quantum kinetic theory designed to describe 
the behaviour of a dilute quantum Bose gas not only at temperature $T=0$ but also at $T>0$. 
Any theory governing the process of laser cooling 
must include both quantum mechanics and kinetics. The problem with the resulting theory is that the equations are 
difficult to handle exactly.

In \cite{GP}, a combination of the mathematics of the BEC description with that of the quantum kinetic theorey is made, 
together with the idea of local energy and momentum conservation  in order 
to overcome this situation. 
The result is an equation governing the coupling of the thermalized condensate band to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
It is a stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation with both additive and multiplicative noise (white in time and correlated in space).
Since building a model often involves many approximations it is not clear exactly which properties have survived. Thus, the model
requires an analytical/computational investigation.
The equation is hitherto not seen in the mathematics community.  



Existence of an invariant measure has been theoretically obtained (see \cite{DO}) 
for a significantly simpler (but somewhat similar) equation. We will persue investigations in this direction.
Several functionals of the solution corresponding to physically interesting properties  are also important to study.  
Perhaps some basic Ito formula can be established.
Of course, the natural starting point is a proof of existence and uniqueness of a solution. A result in this direction for a
simpler equation is \cite{BD2}.

The experience in the physical part of the team is on the case $T=0$ and the related numerical methods. The physical
group within CMA  will therefore gain insight and experience in the $T>0$ case. The topic of Bose-Einstein condensate
is a hot one and shows good promise of being both scientifically and technologically highly interesting  in the foreseeable
future. 

The experience of the mathematical part of the team is based on stochastic partial differential equations. The highly 
non-trivial SPDE associated to Bose-Einstein condensate will ensure that

1) a new important SPDE comes out ``on the market'',

2) the development of tools suitable for this new class of SPDE will be initiated and hopefully, to some extent,  completed, 

3) a development of numerical methods will give interesting numerical results where analytical tools are not yet available.

This will certainly provide original input for the stochastic team at CMA as well as open up for opportunities to delve further 
into this new application. It may also bring about new and original modeling in the finance application.

The article \cite{GP} 
will be the basis for a common investigation and
the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation will be the starting point for both mathematical and 
numerical/computational work aimed at providing a clearer picture of the process of cooling down a Bose gas to condensation.

  
It is hoped that the theoretical studies will result in publication in journals like ``Journals of Mathematical Physics'' and
that the simulation studies be published in e.g. ``Physical Review''.
