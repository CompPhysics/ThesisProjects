    "benchmarks etc at the website of the [Computational Environment for\n",
    "Nuclear Structure](https://github.com/ManyBodyPhysics/CENS) (CENS)\n",
    "and develop a modern (written in C++ eventually Fortran2008) full\n",
    "configuration interaction environment for nuclear structure\n",
    "studies. These codes should be able to \n",
    "* Run on the next generation of supercomputers (collaboration with Oak Ridge National Lab) \n",
    "\n",
    "* Be able to handle both two and three-body interactions \n",
    "\n",
    "* Be able to handle one- and two-body operators \n",
    "\n",
    "* Can be extended to [FCIQMC](https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/37172/master.pdf?sequence=1) studies of finite nuclei and nuclear matter\n",

    "* Shell-model code written in C for [identical particles](https://github.com/ManyBodyPhysics/CENS/tree/master/FCI/serial/IdenticalParticles) and the [proton-neutron case](https://github.com/ManyBodyPhysics/CENS/tree/master/FCI/serial/pnCase)\n",

    "The first step is to study efficient representations of the Slater determinants for words with more than 64 bits, allowing thereby for shell-model studies \n",

    "## Addition about FCIQMC\n",
    "A great challenge is to provide benchmark calculations for the two- and three-dimensional electron gas and infinite nuclear matter. Here, a representation of the single-particle energies in a cartesian basis is essential, see for example the [PhD thesis of Gustav Baardsen](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/41025). \n",

    "The recently developed Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo ([FCIQMC](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v493/n7432/fig_tab/nature11770_F1.html)) method has gained a lot of attention in quantum chemistry, providing benchmark calculations for the homogeneous electron gas in three dimensions. An exciting extension of the developed shell-model code, could be to start studying infinite nuclear matter with the FCIQMC methods. \n",

    "A good introduction, with programs as well, is given by [Karl Leikanger's thesis](https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/37172/master.pdf?sequence=1)"
