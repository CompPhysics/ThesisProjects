<h1 id="___sec0">Aims </h1>

<p>
The aim of this thesis is to develop a diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC)
code that can be used to study properties of confined fermions. The
code should be flexible enough to deal with both closed-shell and
open-shell systems.  The project here is an ambitious one and has enough material
for two independent Master of Science thesis projects.

<p>
The applications will be directed towards studies of electron-electron
correlations in quantum dots as function of the density of the
systems. Properties like single-particle and pair densities will be
studied as the density is lowered towards the eventual Wigner
crystallization.  Quantum dot molecules can also be studied and the
first step would be to repeat calculations done with large-scale
diagonalization techniques for two-electron quantum dot molecules.

<h2 id="___sec1">General introduction to possible physical systems </h2>

<p>
What follows here is a general introduction to systems of confined
electrons in two or three dimensions.  However, although the thesis
will focus on such systems, the codes will be written so that other
systems of trapped fermions or eventually bosons can be
handled. Examples could be neutrons in a harmonic oscillator trap.

<p>
Strongly confined electrons offer a wide variety of complex and subtle
phenomena which pose severe challenges to existing many-body methods.
Quantum dots in particular, that is, electrons confined in
semiconducting heterostructures, exhibit, due to their small size,
discrete quantum levels.  The ground states of, for example, circular
dots show similar shell structures and magic numbers as seen for atoms
and nuclei. These structures are particularly evident in measurements
of the change in electrochemical potential due to the addition of one
extra electron, \( \Delta_N=\mu(N+1)-\mu(N) \). Here \( N \) is the number of
electrons in the quantum dot, and \( \mu(N)=E(N)-E(N-1) \) is the
electrochemical potential of the system.  Theoretical predictions of
\( \Delta_N \) and the excitation energy spectrum require accurate
calculations of ground-state and of excited-state energies.  Small
confined systems, such as quantum dots (QD), have become very popular
for experimental study. Beyond their possible relevance for
nanotechnology, they are highly tunable in experiments and introduce
level quantization and quantum interference in a controlled way. In a
finite system, there cannot, of course, be a true phase transition,
but a cross-over between weakly and strongly correlated regimes is
still expected. There are several other fundamental differences
between quantum dots and bulk systems: (a)\,Broken translational
symmetry in a QD reduces the ability of the electrons to
delocalize. As a result, a Wigner-type cross-over is expected for a
smaller value of \( r_s \) (this is the so-called gas parameter
\( r_s=(c_d/a_B)(1/n)^d \), where \( n \) is the electron density, \( d \) is the
spatial dimension, \( a_B \) the effective Bohr radius and \( c_d \) a
dimension dependent constant). (b)\,Mesoscopic fluctuations, inherent
in any confined system, lead to a rich interplay with the correlation
effects. These two added features make strong correlation physics
particularly interesting in a QD. As clean 2D bulk samples with large
\( r_s \) are regularly fabricated these days in semiconductor
heterostructures, it seems to be just a matter of time before these
systems are patterned into a QD, thus providing an excellent probe of
correlation effects.

<p>
The above-mentioned quantum mechanical levels can, in turn, be tuned
by means of, for example, the application of various external fields.
The spins of the electrons in quantum dots provide a natural basis for
representing so-called qubits. The capability to
manipulate and study such states is evidenced by several recent
experiments.  Coupled quantum dots are particularly
interesting since so-called two-qubit quantum gates can be realized by
manipulating the exchange coupling which originates from the repulsive
Coulomb interaction and the underlying Pauli principle.  For such
states, the exchange coupling splits singlet and triplet states, and
depending on the shape of the confining potential and the applied
magnetic field, one can allow for electrical or magnetic control of
the exchange coupling. In particular, several recent experiments and
theoretical investigations have analyzed the role of effective
spin-orbit interactions in quantum dots and their influence on the
exchange coupling.

<p>
A proper theoretical understanding of the exchange coupling,
correlation energies, ground state energies of quantum dots, the role
of spin-orbit interactions and other properties of quantum dots as
well, requires the development of appropriate and reliable theoretical
few- and many-body methods.  Furthermore, for quantum dots with more
than two electrons and/or specific values of the external fields, this
implies the development of few- and many-body methods where
uncertainty quantifications are provided.  For most methods, this
means providing an estimate of the error due to the truncation made in
the single-particle basis and the truncation made in limiting the
number of possible excitations.  For systems with more than three or
four electrons, <em>ab initio</em> methods that have been employed in
studies of quantum dots are variational and diffusion Monte Carlo, path integral approaches,
large-scale diagonalization (full configuration
interaction, and to a very
limited extent coupled-cluster theory.  Exact
diagonalization studies are accurate for a very small number of
electrons, but the number of basis functions needed to obtain a given
accuracy and the computational cost grow very rapidly with electron
number.  In practice they have been used for up to eight
electrons, but the accuracy is very
limited for all except \( N\le 3 \) .  Monte Carlo methods have been
applied up to \( N=56 \) electrons. Diffusion Monte Carlo, with
statistical and systematic errors, provide, in principle, exact
benchmark solutions to various properties of quantum dots. However,
the computations start becoming rather time-consuming for larger
systems.  Hartree, restricted Hartree-Fock, spin- and/or
space-unrestricted Hartree-Fock and local
spin-density, and current density functional
methods give results that are
satisfactory for a qualitative understanding of some systematic
properties. However, comparisons with exact results show discrepancies
in the energies that are substantial on the scale of energy
differences.

<h2 id="___sec2">Specific tasks </h2>

<p>
The first task of this thesis is to develop a variational (VMC) and diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC)
code that are fully object oriented and parallelized and can tackle
both closed-shell systems and open shell systems. This code should be able to use different single-particle basis functions as input for the Slater determinants used in the VMC and DMC calculations. 
A single-particle basis of interest is the one represented  by  confining double well potential, see the discussion below.
The first step in such a development is to study a system of two
electrons in a double oscillator like well.  This means that we could study
the two-electron 'quantum dot molecule' (QDM) with for example the two-dimensional
Hamiltonian

<p>
The second part includes applications of the codes and studies of
quantum dot systems at different densities, computing both
single-electron densities and pairing densities in order to understand
better electron-electron correlations towards the Wigner
crystallization limit.

<p>
The Hamiltonian of the system to study is given by
$$
H = \sum _{i=1}^2\left ( \frac{ ( {- i {\hbar} \nabla_i}
-\frac ec \mathbf{A})^2 }{2 m^{*}} + V_\mathrm{c}({\bf
r}_{i}) \right ) +  \frac {e^{2}}{ \epsilon   r_{12}} ,
$$

where \( V_\mathrm{c} \) is the external confinement potential
taken to be
$$
 V_\mathrm{c}({\bf r}) = \frac 12 m^* \omega_0^2 \min \left[
 \sum_j^M ({\bf r} - {\bf L}_j)^2 \right],
$$

where the coordinates are in two dimensions \( \mathbf{r} = (x,y) \) and the \( L_j \)'s (\( L_j = (\pm L_x, \pm L_y) \)) give the positions of the
minima of the QDM potential, and \( M \) is the number of minima. When
\( \mathbf{L}_1=(0,0) \) (and \( M=1 \)) we have a single parabolic QD. With
\( M=2 \) and \( \mathbf{L}_{1,2} = (\pm L_x,0) \) we get a double-dot
potential. One can also study four-minima QDM (\( M=4 \)) with minima at four
possibilities of \( (\pm L_x,\pm L_y) \) (see the figure here).

<p>
<br /><br /><center><p><img src="figslides/doublewell.pdf" align="bottom" width=500></p></center><br /><br />

<p>
 We can study both square-symmetric (\( L_x=L_y \)) and rectangular-symmetric
(\( L_x \neq L_y \)) four-minima QDMs. The confinement
potential can also be written using the absolute values of \( x \) and \( y \)
coordinates as
$$
V_\mathrm{c}(x,y) = \frac 12 m^* \omega_0^2 \left[ r^2 - 2 L_x |x| - 2 L_y |y| + L_x^2 + L_y^2 \right].
$$

For non-zero \( L_x \) and \( L_y \), 
the perturbation to the parabolic potential comes from the linear
terms of \( L_x \) or \( L_y \) containing also the absolute value of the
associated coordinate.
