<h2 id="___sec0" class="anchor">Bayesian Machine Learning, Level Densities and Probability  </h2>

<p>
The level density \( \rho(E) \) as function of energy \( E \) plays a central in many
physics applications, ranging from the modeling of nuclear
astrophysics reactions central to the synthesis of the elements to the
classification and understanding of phases and phase transition in for example condensed matter
physics.

<p>
In statistical physics it defines the thermodynamical potential in the micro-canonical ensemble and thereby the entropy as
$$
S(E) = -k_B \ln{(\rho(E))},
$$

and the partition function \( Z(\beta) \) (with \( \beta = 1/k_BT \))  as
$$
Z(\beta) = \int dE \exp{(-\beta E)}\rho(E),
$$

and the expectation values of various moments of the energy
as
$$
\mathbb{E}^n(\beta) = \frac{\int dE E^n\exp{(-\beta E)}\rho(E)}{Z(\beta)}. 
$$

We can rewrite this equation as
$$
\mathbb{E}^n(\beta) = \int dE E^n P(E\vert\beta), 
$$

<p>
where \( P(E\vert\beta) \) is the likelihood of being in a state with
energy \( E \) with temperature \( \beta \). The probability is defined as

$$
P(E\vert\beta) = \frac{\exp{(-\beta E)}\rho(E)}{Z(\beta)}. 
$$

<p>
With the density of states we can in turn define a probability
distribution function (PDF) in say for example the canonical
ensemble. Alternatively, if we have the PDF we can find the density of
states. Having a PDF allows us also to quantify in a rigorous way statistical
confidence intervals, statistical errors and other statistical quantities with far reaching
consequences for our understanding of a specific physics problem. 
In experiments we do however normally not have the above
quantities. This means that we need to translate experimental results
via some theoretical modeling into suitable quantities that can be
used to define either a PDF or the density of states.

<p>
A typical situation which occurs in for example nuclear reaction
experiments performed at the cyclotron of the University of Oslo, is
that one can extract the number of counts as function of the
excitation energy \( E_x \) of a given nucleus and the resulting gmamma
energy \( E_{\gamma} \) from Compton scattering. This quantity, labelled
\( N(E_x,E_{\gamma}) \) can in turn be used to define either a PDF or the density of state.

<p>
In this project we will use Bayesian statistics and Bayesian machine
learning to extract first the PDF based on the above experimental data
in order to define a posterior distribution \( P(E_x\vertE_{\gamma}) \),
that is the likelihood of the state of energy \( E_x \) given a certain
\( \gamma \)-energy.  This quantity will in turn be used to identify a
density of states.

<p>
In order to get familiar

<h2 id="___sec1" class="anchor">Thesis Projects </h2>

<p>
The aim of this thesis project is employ Bayesian machine learning to
define a PDF, either from experiment or from theoretical simulations.
Eventually, based on the PDF, can attempt to define a a level density
\( \rho(E) \), or the other way around. The first step is to use an
already available model for extracting the level density from exact
diagonalization. These data will then be used to define a posterior
distribution based on a Bayesian machine learning approach.

<h3 id="___sec2" class="anchor">Specific tasks and milestones  </h3>

<p>
The projects can easily be split into several parts and form the basis for collaborations among several students. The milestones are as follows

<ol>
<li> Spring 2020:</li> 
<li> Fall 2020:</li> 
<li> Spring 2021:</li> 
</ol>

The thesis is expected to be handed in May/June  2021.

<h3 id="___sec3" class="anchor">Appendix: Brief note on Bayesian Statistics </h3>

<p>
The aim is  to assess hypotheses by calculating their probabilities \( p(H_i | \ldots) \) conditional on known and/or presumed information using the rules of probability theory.
Bayes' theorem is based on the standard  Probability Theory Axioms:

<ol>
<li> Product (AND) rule : \( p(A, B | I) = p(A|I) p(B|A, I) = p(B|I)p(A|B,I) \). Should read \( p(A,B|I) \) as the probability for propositions \( A \) AND \( B \) being true given that \( I \) is true.</li>
<li> Sum (OR) rule: \( p(A + B | I) = p(A | I) + p(B | I) - p(A, B | I) \). \( p(A+B|I) \) is the probability that proposition \( A \) OR \( B \) is true given that \( I \) is true.</li>
<li> Normalization: \( p(A|I) + p(\bar{A}|I) = 1 \). \( \bar{A} \) denotes the proposition that \( A \) is false.</li>
</ol>

Bayes' theorem follows directly from the product rule
$$
$$
p(A|B,I) = \frac{p(B|A,I) p(A|I)}{p(B|I)}.
$$
$$

The importance of this property to data analysis becomes apparent if we replace \( A \) and \( B \) by hypothesis(\( H \)) and data(\( D \)):
$$
\begin{align}
p(H|D,I) &= \frac{p(D|H,I) p(H|I)}{p(D|I)}.
\label{eq:bayes}
\end{align}
$$

The power of Bayes&#8217; theorem lies in the fact that it relates the quantity of interest, the probability that the hypothesis is true given the data, to the term we have a better chance of being able to assign, the probability that we would have observed the measured data if the hypothesis was true.

<p>
The various terms in Bayes&#8217; theorem have formal names. 

<ul>
<li> The quantity on the far right, \( p(H|I) \), is called the <em>prior</em> probability; it represents our state of knowledge (or ignorance) about the truth of the hypothesis before we have analysed the current data.</li> 
<li> This is modified by the experimental measurements through \( p(D|H,I) \), the <em>likelihood</em> function,</li> 
<li> The denominator \( p(D|I) \) is called the <em>evidence</em>. It does not depend on the hypothesis and can be regarded as a normalization constant.</li>
<li> Together, these yield the <em>posterior</em> probability, \( p(H|D, I ) \), representing our state of knowledge about the truth of the hypothesis in the light of the data.</li> 
</ul>
