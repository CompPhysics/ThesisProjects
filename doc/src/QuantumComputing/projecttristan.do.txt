===== Quantum Computing and Machine Learning =====



_Quantum Computing and Machine Learning_ are two of the most promising
approaches for studying complex physical systems where several length
and energy scales are involved.  Traditional many-particle methods,
either quantum mechanical or classical ones, face huge dimensionality
problems when applied to studies of systems with many interacting
particles. To be able to define properly effective potentials for
realistic molecular dynamics simulations of billions or more
particles, requires both precise quantum mechanical studies as well as
algorithms that allow for parametrizations and simplifications of
quantum mechanical results. Quantum Computing offers now an
interesting avenue, together with traditional algorithms, for studying
complex quantum mechanical systems. Machine Learning on the other hand
allows us to parametrize these results in terms of classical
interactions. These interactions are in turn suitable for large scale
molecular dynamics simulations of complicated systems spanning from
subatomic physics to materials science and life science.


=== Quantum Phase Estimation and Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (Quantum-mechanical many-body Physics) ===

The specific task here is to implenent and study Quantum Computing
algorithms like the Quantum-Phase Estimation algorithm and Variational
Quantum Eigensolvers for solving quantum mechanical many-particle
problems.  Recent scientific articles have shown the reliability of
these methods on existing and real quantum computers, see for example
references [1-5] below.


Here the focus is first on tailoring a Hamiltonian like the pairing
Hamiltonian and/or Anderson Hamiltonian in terms of quantum gates, as
done in references [3-5]. Getting familiar with "Qiskit":"https://qiskit.org/" in order to set up quantum circuits for running calculations is an important milestone
of this work.

Reproducing these results will be the main step of this 
project. The next step includes adding more complicated terms to the
Hamiltonian, like a particle-hole interaction as done in the work of
"Hjorth-Jensen et
al":"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0954-3899/37/6/064035/meta".

The final step is to implement the action of these Hamiltonians on
existing quantum computers like "Rigetti's Quantum
Computer":"https://www.rigetti.com/" or different IBM computers or the local SpinQ quantum computer at Oslo Metropolitan University.
