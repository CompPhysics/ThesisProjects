\title{Thesis title: Thesis title: Diffusion Monte Carlo studies of systems of confined fermions}
\author{Karl Leikanger}
\maketitle
\section*{Aims}
The aim of this thesis is to develop a diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) code that can be used to study properties 
of confined fermions. The code should be flexible enough to deal with both closed-shell and open-shell systems.
If time allows, the implementation of the algorithm of Booth {\em et al}, see Ref.~\cite{booth2009}, which combines DMC calculations and full-scale diagonalization implementations (developed by a fellow Master of Science student, Frank Olsen), would allievate considerably the Monte Carlo sign problem in DMC studies.

The applications will be directed towards studies of electron-electron correlations in quantum dots
as function of the density of the systems. Properties like single-particle and pair densities will be studied
as the density is lowered towards the eventual Wigner crystallization. 
Quantum dot molecules can also be studied and the first step would be to repeat calculations done with
large-scale diagonalization techniques for two-electron quantum dot molecules.

\subsection*{General introduction to possible physical systems}


What follows here is a general introduction to systems of confined electrons in two or three dimensions.
However, although the thesis will focus on such systems, the codes will be written so 
that other systems of trapped 
fermions or eventually bosons can be handled. Examples could be neutrons in a harmonic oscillator trap, see for example Ref.~\cite{bogner2011}, or ions in various traps \cite{yoram2008}.  

Strongly confined electrons
offer a wide variety of complex and subtle phenomena which pose severe 
challenges to existing many-body methods.
Quantum dots in particular, that is, electrons confined in semiconducting heterostructures,
exhibit, due to their small size, discrete quantum levels. 
The ground states of, for example, circular dots
show similar shell structures and magic numbers 
as seen for atoms and nuclei. These structures are particularly evident in
measurements of the change in electrochemical potential due to the addition of
one extra electron, 
$\Delta_N=\mu(N+1)-\mu(N)$. Here $N$ is the number of electrons in the quantum dot, and
$\mu(N)=E(N)-E(N-1)$ is the electrochemical potential of the system.
Theoretical predictions of $\Delta_N$ and the excitation energy spectrum require
accurate calculations of ground-state and of excited-state energies.
Small confined systems, such as quantum dots (QD), have become very popular for experimental 
study. Beyond their possible relevance for nanotechnology, they are highly tunable 
in experiments and introduce level quantization and quantum interference in a controlled way. In a finite system, 
there cannot, of course, be a true phase transition, but a cross-over between weakly and strongly correlated regimes is 
still expected. There are several other fundamental differences between quantum dots and bulk systems: (a)\,Broken translational 
symmetry in a QD reduces the ability of the electrons to delocalize. As a result, a Wigner-type cross-over 
is expected for a smaller value of $r_s$ (this is the so-called gas parameter $r_s=(c_d/a_B)(1/n)^d$, where $n$ is the electron density, $d$ is the spatial dimension, $a_B$ the effective Bohr radius and  $c_d$ a dimension dependent constant). (b)\,Mesoscopic fluctuations, inherent in any confined system, 
lead to a rich interplay with the correlation effects. These two added features make strong correlation physics particularly 
interesting in a QD. As clean 2D bulk samples with large $r_s$ are regularly fabricated these days in semiconductor 
heterostructures, it seems to be just a matter of time before these systems are patterned into a QD, 
thus providing an excellent probe of correlation effects.



The above-mentioned quantum mechanical levels can, in turn, be tuned by means
of, for example, the application of various external fields.  
The spins of the electrons in quantum dots
provide a natural basis for representing so-called qubits \cite{divincenzo1996}. The capability to manipulate
and study such states is evidenced by several recent experiments \cite{exp1,exp2}.
Coupled quantum dots are particularly interesting since so-called  
two-qubit quantum gates can be realized by manipulating the 
exchange coupling which originates from the repulsive Coulomb interaction 
and the underlying Pauli principle.  For such states, the exchange coupling splits singlet and triplet states, 
and depending on the shape of the confining potential and the applied magnetic field, one can allow
for electrical or magnetic control of the exchange coupling. In particular, several recent experiments and 
theoretical investigations have analyzed the role of effective spin-orbit interactions 
in quantum dots \cite{exp5,exp6,pederiva2010,spinorbit} and their influence on the exchange coupling.

A proper theoretical understanding of the exchange coupling, correlation energies, 
ground state energies of quantum dots, the role of spin-orbit interactions
and other properties of quantum dots as well, requires the development of appropriate and reliable  
theoretical  few- and many-body methods. 
Furthermore, for quantum dots with more than two electrons and/or specific values of the 
external fields, this implies the development of few- and many-body methods where   
uncertainty
quantifications are provided.  
For most methods, this means providing an estimate of the error due 
to the truncation made in the single-particle basis and the truncation made in 
limiting the number of possible excitations.
For systems with more than three or four electrons,  {\em ab initio} methods that have 
been employed in studies of quantum dots are
 variational and diffusion Monte Carlo \cite{harju2005,pederiva2001, pederiva2003}, path integral approaches \cite{pi1999}, 
large-scale diagonalization (full configuration 
interaction) \cite{Eto97,Maksym90,simen2008,modena2000}, and to a very limited extent 
coupled-cluster theory \cite{shavittbartlett2009,bartlett2007,bartlett2003,indians}. 
Exact diagonalization studies are accurate for a very small number
of electrons, but the number of basis functions needed to obtain a given
accuracy and the computational cost grow very rapidly with electron number.
In practice they have been used for up to eight electrons\cite{Eto97,Maksym90,modena2000}, but the accuracy is
very limited for all except $N\le 3$ .  
Monte Carlo methods have been applied up to $N=24$ electrons 
\cite{pederiva2001,pederiva2003}. Diffusion Monte Carlo, with statistical and systematic errors, provide, in principle,
exact benchmark solutions to various properties of quantum dots. However, 
the computations start becoming rather time-consuming for larger systems.   
Hartree\cite{Kum90}, restricted Hartree-Fock, spin- and/or space-unrestricted
Hartree-Fock\cite{Fuj96,Mul96,Yan99} and
local spin-density, and current density functional methods\cite{Kos97,Hir99,finns1,finns2}
give results that are satisfactory for a qualitative understanding of some
systematic properties. However, comparisons with exact results show
discrepancies in the energies that are substantial
on the scale of energy differences. 


\subsection*{Specific tasks}

The first task of this thesis is develop a diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) code that is fully object oriented and
parallelized and can tackle both closed-shell systems and open shell systems. If time allows, the implementation  of an algorithm which combines DMC studies with full-scale configuration interaction (FCI) methods will allievate the DMC sign problem. The latter is normally treated using the fixed node approach. The algorithm
of Booth {\em et al} \cite{booth2009} holds great promise for circumventing the problems inherent to the fixed node approach. To combine DMC with FCI requires the usage and adaption of an existing and efficient 
FCI code written by a fellow Master of Science student, Frank Olsen. 

The second part includes applications of the codes and studies of quantum dot systems at different 
densities, computing both single-electron densities and pairing densities in order to understand 
better electron-electron correlations towards the Wigner crystallization limit, see Goshal {\em et al}
for an excellent reference \cite{ghosal2007}. 

The final application part would be to change the confining potential to that of a double well. The first step
is to study a system of two electrons in a double oscillator like well. 
This means that we would the two-electron 'quantum dot molecule' (QDM)  with the two-dimensional Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
H = \sum _{i=1}^2\left ( \frac{ ( {- i {\hbar} \nabla_i}
-\frac ec \mathbf{A})^2 }{2 m^{*}} + V_\mathrm{c}({\bf
r}_{i}) \right ) +  \frac {e^{2}}{ \epsilon   r_{12} } \ ,
\label{ham}
\end{equation}
where $V_\mathrm{c}$ is the external confinement potential
taken to be
\begin{equation}
 V_\mathrm{c}({\bf r}) = \frac 12 m^* \omega_0^2 \min \left[
 \sum_j^M ({\bf r} - {\bf L}_j)^2 \right] \ ,
\label{Vc}
\end{equation}
where the coordinates are in two dimensions ${\bf r} = (x,y)$ and the ${\bf
L}_j$'s (${\bf L}_j = (\pm L_x, \pm L_y)$) give the positions of the
minima of the QDM potential, and $M$ is the number of minima. When
${\bf L}_1=(0,0)$ (and $M=1$) we have a single parabolic QD. With
$M=2$ and ${\bf L}_{1,2} = (\pm L_x,0)$ we get a double-dot
potential. One can also study four-minima QDM ($M=4$) with minima at four
possibilities of $(\pm L_x,\pm L_y)$ (see Fig.~\ref{pot}).
%
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics*[width=1.0\columnwidth]{doublewell.pdf}
\caption{Confinement potential of square-symmetric ($L_x=L_y=5$ nm)
four-minima quantum dot molecule.}
\label{pot}
\end{figure}
%
 We study both square-symmetric ($L_x=L_y$) and rectangular-symmetric
($L_x \neq L_y$) four-minima QDMs. The confinement
potential can also be written using the absolute values of $x$ and $y$
coordinates as
\begin{eqnarray}
V_\mathrm{c}(x,y) &=& \frac 12 m^* \omega_0^2 \times \nonumber\\ &&
\left[ r^2 - 2 L_x |x| - 2 L_y |y| + L_x^2 + L_y^2 \right] \ .
\label{Vc_auki}
\end{eqnarray}
For non-zero $L_x$ and $L_y$, 
the perturbation to the parabolic potential comes from the linear
terms of $L_x$ or $L_y$ containing also the absolute value of the
associated coordinate.
