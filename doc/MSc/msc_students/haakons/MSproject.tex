\title{Thesis title: Quantum-mechanical systems in traps and density functional theory}
\author{H\aa kon Sebastian Bakke M\o rk}
\maketitle
\section*{Aims}
The aim of this thesis is to study the structure of quantum dots
(mainly two- and three-dimensional electronic systems) using {\em ab initio} 
variational and diffusion function Monte Carlo
techniques. The thesis will explore various Monte Carlo optimalization
strategies and implement systems were electrons are confined to move
in one or two potential wells.

\subsection*{General introduction to possible physical systems}

What follows here a general introduction to systems of confined electrons in two or three dimensions.
However, although the thesis will focus on such systems, the codes will be written so that other systems of trapped 
fermions or eventually bosons can be handled. Examples could be neutrons in trap as done in Ref.~\cite{bogner2011} or ions in various traps \cite{yoram2008}.  

Strongly confined electrons
offer a wide variety of complex and subtle phenomena which pose severe 
challenges to existing many-body methods.
Quantum dots in particular, that is, electrons confined in semiconducting heterostructures,
exhibit, due to their small size, discrete quantum levels. 
The ground states of, for example, circular dots
show similar shell structures and magic numbers 
as seen for atoms and nuclei. These structures are particularly evident in
measurements of the change in electrochemical potential due to the addition of
one extra electron, 
$\Delta_N=\mu(N+1)-\mu(N)$. Here $N$ is the number of electrons in the quantum dot, and
$\mu(N)=E(N)-E(N-1)$ is the electrochemical potential of the system.
Theoretical predictions of $\Delta_N$ and the excitation energy spectrum require
accurate calculations of ground-state and of excited-state energies.
Small confined systems, such as quantum dots (QD), have become very popular for experimental 
study. Beyond their possible relevance for nanotechnology, they are highly tunable 
in experiments and introduce level quantization and quantum interference in a controlled way. In a finite system, 
there can not, of course, be a true phase transition, but a cross-over between weakly and strongly correlated regimes is 
still expected. There are several other fundamental differences between quantum dots and bulk systems: (a)\,Broken translational 
symmetry in a QD reduces the ability of the electrons to delocalize. As a result, a Wigner-type cross-over 
is expected for a smaller value of $r_s$. (b)\,Mesoscopic fluctuations, inherent in any confined system, 
lead to a rich interplay with the correlation effects. These two added features make strong correlation physics particularly 
interesting in a QD. As clean 2D bulk samples with large $r_s$ are regularly fabricated these days in semiconductor 
heterostructures, it seems to be just a matter of time before these systems are patterned into a QD, 
thus providing an excellent probe of correlation effects.



The above-mentioned quantum mechanical levels can, in turn, be tuned by means
of, for example, the application of various external fields.  
The spins of the electrons in quantum dots
provide a natural basis for representing so-called qubits \cite{divincenzo1996}. The capability to manipulate
and study such states is evidenced by several recent experiments \cite{exp1,exp2}.
Coupled quantum dots are particularly interesting since so-called  
two-qubit quantum gates can be realized by manipulating the 
exchange coupling which originates from the repulsive Coulomb interaction 
and the underlying Pauli principle.  For such states, the exchange coupling splits singlet and triplet states, 
and depending on the shape of the confining potential and the applied magnetic field, one can allow
for electrical or magnetic control of the exchange coupling. In particular, several recent experiments and 
theoretical investigations have analyzed the role of effective spin-orbit interactions 
in quantum dots \cite{exp5,exp6,pederiva2010,spinorbit} and their influence on the exchange coupling.

A proper theoretical understanding of the exchange coupling, correlation energies, 
ground state energies of quantum dots, the role of spin-orbit interactions
and other properties of quantum dots as well, requires the development of appropriate and reliable  
theoretical  few- and many-body methods. 
Furthermore, for quantum dots with more than two electrons and/or specific values of the 
external fields, this implies the development of few- and many-body methods where   
uncertainty
quantifications are provided.  
For most methods, this means providing an estimate of the error due 
to the truncation made in the single-particle basis and the truncation made in 
limiting the number of possible excitations.
For systems with more than three or four electrons,  {\em ab initio} methods that have 
been employed in studies of quantum dots are
 variational and diffusion Monte Carlo \cite{harju2005,pederiva2001, pederiva2003}, path integral approaches \cite{pi1999}, 
large-scale diagonalization (full configuration 
interaction) \cite{Eto97,Maksym90,simen2008,modena2000}, and to a very limited extent 
coupled-cluster theory \cite{shavittbartlett2009,bartlett2007,bartlett2003,indians,us2011}. 
Exact diagonalization studies are accurate for a very small number
of electrons, but the number of basis functions needed to obtain a given
accuracy and the computational cost grow very rapidly with electron number.
In practice they have been used for up to eight electrons\cite{Eto97,Maksym90,modena2000}, but the accuracy is
very limited for all except $N\le 3$ .  
Monte Carlo methods have been applied up to $N=24$ electrons 
\cite{pederiva2001,pederiva2003}. Diffusion Monte Carlo, with statistical and systematic errors, provide, in principle,
exact benchmark solutions to various properties of quantum dots. However, 
the computations start becoming rather time-consuming for larger systems.   
Hartree\cite{Kum90}, restricted Hartree-Fock, spin- and/or space-unrestricted
Hartree-Fock\cite{Fuj96,Mul96,Yan99} and
local spin-density, and current density functional methods\cite{Kos97,Hir99,finns1,finns2}
give results that are satisfactory for a qualitative understanding of some
systematic properties. However, comparisons with exact results show
discrepancies in the energies that are substantial
on the scale of energy differences. 

For systems with many electrons many, the dimensionalities of the systems render the usage of many of the above methods almost impossible. Density functional theory is now the computational paradigm for quantum mechanical calculations of energies and other properties of molecules and condensed matter. Furthermore, the 
time-dependent theory applies particularly to electronic excitations and interactions with 
the electromagnetic field, see for example Lecture Notes in Physics, volume 837. 

\subsection*{Specific tasks}
The specific aim of this thesis is, based on an already developed Variational Monte Carlo code by the candidate,
 to develop a diffusion Monte Carlo program for quantum dots (a program which could be extended to other systems as well and to electrons confined in three dimensions) which will allow for exact benchmarks and reference for
closed-shell systems with up to approximately $\sim 50-70$ electrons. 

The final aim is to be able to describe two-dimensional and
three-dimensional electron systems where the motion of the electrons
is confined to either one potential well or two potential wells.  The
single-particle basis obtained from such solutions will in turn be
used to in the construction of the Slater determinant which enters the
calculation of energies, onebody and twobody densities. 
Systems like double quantum-dot wells have been used as potential candidates for constructing quantum gates and their structure and dynamical properties are central to our development of quantum circuits. 

\section*{Progress plan and milestones}
The aims and progress plan of this thesis are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fall 2015
\begin{itemize}
\item Based on the variational Monte Carlo code developed by H\aa kon, study single-well quantum dots (in oscillator like potentials) for two, six, twelve and twenty electrons. Compare the results with the published results
of Ref.~\cite{us2011}. 
\item Perform thereafter a Hartree-Fock calculations for single-well quantum dots for the same number of electrons as in the previous steps. Parametrize the Hartree-Fock solutions in terms of harmonic oscillator functions and 
use these parametrized single-particle energies in the calculation of the Slater determinant and repeat the above
variational Monte Carlo calculations.
\item The code should be made flexible enough to be extended to trapped electrons or other trapped
fermionic systems in two and three dimensions. An optimized and parallel version of the code should be tested
for systems up to or larger than $\sim 70$ electrons. 
\item Construct thereafter a single-particle basis for an electron moving in a double quantum well
\[
V(x,y) = \frac{1}{2} m^*\omega^2(x^2+y^2-2L_x\vert x\vert +L_x^2),
\]
with the mass $m^*=0.067m_e$ and is the effective electron mass in materials like GaAs. The confinment strength is
$\hbar\omega = 3.0$ meV. The two minima are of the potential wells are separated by a distance $2L_x$. The following Python program produces a plot of the potential well.
\begin{verbatim}
import numpy as np
from  matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import rc, rcParams
import matplotlib.units as units
import matplotlib.ticker as ticker
rc('text',usetex=True)
rc('font',**{'family':'serif','serif':['Double-well potential']})
font = {'family' : 'serif',
        'color'  : 'darkred',
        'weight' : 'normal',
        'size'   : 16,
        }
m = 0.067
homega = 3.0
Lx = 50.0
x = np.linspace(-120.0, 120.0)
v = 0.5*m*homega*(x*x-2*Lx*abs(x)+Lx*Lx)

plt.plot(x, v, 'b-')
plt.title(r'{\bf Double-well potential for $L_x=50$ [nm]}', fontsize=20)     
plt.text(-100, 350, r'Parameters: $m*=0.067m_e$, $\hbar\omega=3.0$ [meV]', fontdict=font)
plt.text(-100, 300, r'$L_x=50$ [nm]', fontdict=font)
plt.xlabel(r'$x$ [nm]',fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel(r'$V(x,0)$ [MeV]',fontsize=20)

# Tweak spacing to prevent clipping of ylabel
plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.15)
plt.savefig('double.pdf', format='pdf')
\end{verbatim}
Find the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions for the lowest-lying electron states and parametrize these again in terms of harmonic oscillator functions. 
Other potentials are also possible, like the smoother Gaussian barrier potential
\[
V(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}\omega \left(x^2+y^2+V_0\exp{-(\frac{-x^2}{2\sigma})}\right). 
\]
\end{itemize}
Chapter 6.4 of the MSc thesis of Yang Min Wang, see \url{https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/11049}, contains many of the needed details.
\item Spring 2016
\begin{itemize}
\item Perform thereafter a Hartree-Fock calculation for the double well for closed-shell systems up to $20$ electrons
and parametrize these wave functions again in terms of harmonic oscillator functions. Use these wave functions 
in the calculation of the Slater determinant.
 \item The next step is to perform variational Monte Carlo calculations for two and more electrons confined
to move in the above double potential well.
\item The final step, if time allows, is to extend the variational Monte Carlo calculations to a diffusion Monte Carlo calculation. 
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
The thesis is expected to be handed in June 1 2016.
