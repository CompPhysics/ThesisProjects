\section*{Thesis title: Quantum-mechanical systems in traps and pertinent many-body methods}

\subsection*{General introduction to possible physical systems}
Strongly confined electrons
offer a wide variety of complex and subtle phenomena which pose severe 
challenges to existing many-body methods.
Quantum dots in particular, that is, electrons confined in semiconducting heterostructures,
exhibit, due to their small size, discrete quantum levels. 
The ground states of, for example, circular dots
show similar shell structures and magic numbers 
as seen for atoms and nuclei. These structures are particularly evident in
measurements of the change in electrochemical potential due to the addition of
one extra electron, 
$\Delta_N=\mu(N+1)-\mu(N)$. Here $N$ is the number of electrons in the quantum dot, and
$\mu(N)=E(N)-E(N-1)$ is the electrochemical potential of the system.
Theoretical predictions of $\Delta_N$ and the excitation energy spectrum require
accurate calculations of ground-state and of excited-state energies.
Small confined systems, such as quantum dots (QD), have become very popular for experimental 
study \cite{MesoTran97,HeissQdotBook}. Beyond their possible relevance for nanotechnology, they are highly tunable 
in experiments and introduce level quantization and quantum interference in a controlled way. In a finite system, 
there can not, of course, be a true phase transition, but a cross-over between weakly and strongly correlated regimes is 
still expected. There are several other fundamental differences between quantum dots and bulk systems: (a)\,Broken translational 
symmetry in a QD reduces the ability of the electrons to delocalize. As a result, a Wigner-type cross-over 
is expected for a smaller value of $r_s$. (b)\,Mesoscopic fluctuations, inherent in any confined system \cite{MesoTran97,MesoHouches}, 
lead to a rich interplay with the correlation effects. These two added features make strong correlation physics particularly 
interesting in a QD. As clean 2D bulk samples with large $r_s$ are regularly fabricated these days in semiconductor 
heterostructures \cite{lowdens2DEG}, it seems to be just a matter of time before these systems are patterned into a QD, 
thus providing an excellent probe of correlation effects.



The above-mentioned quantum mechanical levels can, in turn, be tuned by means
of, for example, the application of various external fields.  
The spins of the electrons in quantum dots
provide a natural basis for representing so-called qubits \cite{divincenzo1996}. The capability to manipulate
and study such states is evidenced by several recent experiments (see, for example, Refs.~\onlinecite{exp1,exp2}).
Coupled quantum dots are particularly interesting since so-called  
two-qubit quantum gates can be realized by manipulating the 
exchange coupling which originates from the repulsive Coulomb interaction 
and the underlying Pauli principle.  For such states, the exchange coupling splits singlet and triplet states, 
and depending on the shape of the confining potential and the applied magnetic field, one can allow
for electrical or magnetic control of the exchange coupling. In particular, several recent experiments and 
theoretical investigations have analyzed the role of effective spin-orbit interactions 
in quantum dots \cite{exp5,exp6,pederiva2010,spinorbit} and their influence on the exchange coupling.

A proper theoretical understanding of the exchange coupling, correlation energies, 
ground state energies of quantum dots, the role of spin-orbit interactions
and other properties of quantum dots as well, requires the development of appropriate and reliable  
theoretical  few- and many-body methods. 
Furthermore, for quantum dots with more than two electrons and/or specific values of the 
external fields, this implies the development of few- and many-body methods where   
uncertainty
quantifications are provided.  
For most methods, this means providing an estimate of the error due 
to the truncation made in the single-particle basis and the truncation made in 
limiting the number of possible excitations.
For systems with more than three or four electrons,  {\em ab initio} methods that have 
been employed in studies of quantum dots are
 variational and diffusion Monte Carlo \cite{harju2005,pederiva2001, pederiva2003}, path integral approaches \cite{pi1999}, 
large-scale diagonalization (full configuration 
interaction) \cite{Eto97,Maksym90,simen2008,modena2000}, and to a very limited extent 
coupled-cluster theory \cite{shavittbartlett2009,bartlett2007,bartlett2003,indians,us2011}. 
Exact diagonalization studies are accurate for a very small number
of electrons, but the number of basis functions needed to obtain a given
accuracy and the computational cost grow very rapidly with electron number.
In practice they have been used for up to eight electrons\cite{Eto97,Maksym90,modena2000}, but the accuracy is
very limited for all except $N\le 3$ (see, for example, Refs.~\onlinecite{simen2008,kvaal2009}).  
Monte Carlo methods have been applied up to $N=24$ electrons 
\cite{pederiva2001,pederiva2003}. Diffusion Monte Carlo, with statistical and systematic errors, provide, in principle,
exact benchmark solutions to various properties of quantum dots. However, 
the computations start becoming rather time-consuming for larger systems.   
Hartree\cite{Kum90}, restricted Hartree-Fock, spin- and/or space-unrestricted
Hartree-Fock\cite{Fuj96,Mul96,Yan99} and
local spin-density, and current density functional methods\cite{Kos97,Hir99,finns1,finns2}
give results that are satisfactory for a qualitative understanding of some
systematic properties. However, comparisons with exact results show
discrepancies in the energies that are substantial
on the scale of energy differences. 



\subsection*{Specific tasks}


One path to decouple high-momentum degrees of freedom is the
similarity renormalization group (SRG), which was introduced
independently by Glazek and Wilson~\cite{glazek1993} and
Wegner~\cite{wegner1994}. The SRG consists of a continuous sequence of
unitary transformations that suppress off-diagonal matrix elements,
driving the Hamiltonian towards a band- or block-diagonal
form. Writing the unitarily transformed Hamiltonian as
\be
 H(s) = U(s) H U^\dagger(s) \equiv H^{\rm d}(s)+H^{\rm od}(s) \,,
\label{eq:ham_uni_trans}
\ee
where $H^{\rm d}(s)$ and $H^{\rm od}(s)$ are the appropriately defined
``diagonal'' and ``off-diagonal'' parts of the Hamiltonian, the
evolution with the flow parameter $s$ is given by
\be
\frac{dH(s)}{ds} = [\eta(s),H(s)] \,.
\label{eq:fs_srg_flow_eqn}
\ee
Here $\eta(s) \equiv [dU(s)/ds] \, U^{\dagger}(s)$ is the
anti-Hermitian generator of the transformation. The choice of the
generator first suggested by Wegner,
\be
 \eta(s) = [H^{\rm d}(s),H(s)] = [H^{\rm d}(s),H^{\rm od}(s)] \,,
\label{eq:eta_weg4}
\ee
guarantees that the off-diagonal coupling of $H^{\rm od}$ is driven
exponentially to zero with increasing $s$~\cite{wegner1994}. Through
different choices for $H^{\rm d}$ and $H^{\rm od}$, one can tailor the
SRG evolution to transform the initial Hamiltonian to a form that is
most convenient for a particular problem~\cite{kehrein2006,white2002}.
It is this flexibility, together with the fact that one never
explicitly constructs and applies the unitary transformation $U(s)$
[rather it is implemented implicitly through the integration of
Eq.~(\ref{eq:fs_srg_flow_eqn})] that makes the SRG a powerful
alternative to conventional effective interaction methods such as
Lee-Suzuki similarity transformations~\cite{vlowkreview}.

To date, the SRG applications to nuclear forces have been carried out
in free space to construct ``soft'' nucleon-nucleon (NN) and
three-nucleon (3N) interactions to be used as input in ab-initio
calculations~\cite{vlowkreview,SRGUCOM}. While
the free-space evolution is convenient, as it does not have to be
performed for each different nucleus or nuclear matter density, it is
necessary to handle 3N (and possibly higher-body) interactions to be
able to lower the cutoff significantly and maintain approximate
cutoff independence of $A \geqslant 3$ observables. The SRG
evolution of 3N operators represents a significant technical challenge
that has only recently been solved in a convenient
basis~\cite{jurgenson3Nsrg}.

normal-ordered two-body level, IM-SRG(2), for $^{4}$He using the
generators $\eta^{\rm I}$ (left) and $\eta^{\rm II}$ (right

Eqs.~(\ref{eq:e0_flow})--(\ref{eq:2b_flow}) with the underlined terms
omitted (included). The ground-state energy $E_0(\infty)$ 
is given as a function
of the harmonic oscillator parameter $\hbar \omega$ with increasing

interaction is a free-space SRG-evolved potential with $\lambda=2.0
\fmi$ from the N$^3$LO potential of Ref.~\cite{entem2003n3lo}. For
comparison we show the coupled-cluster CCSD and CCSD(T) energies in
the $e_{\rm max}=8$ space (calculated at their $\hbar \omega$ minimum).
\label{fig:he4_srg2.00}}

\end{figure}

An interesting alternative is to perform the SRG evolution directly in
the $A$-body system of
interest~\cite{wegner1994,kehrein2006,white2002}. Unlike the
free-space evolution, the in-medium SRG (IM-SRG) has the appealing feature that
one can approximately evolve $3,...,A$-body operators using only
two-body machinery. The key to this simplification is the use of
normal-ordering with respect to a finite-density reference
state. Starting from a general second-quantized Hamiltonian with two-
and three-body interactions, all operators can be normal ordered with
respect to a finite-density Fermi vacuum $|\Phi\rangle$ (e.g., the
Hartree-Fock ground state), as opposed to the zero-particle
vacuum. Wick's theorem can then be used to exactly write $H$ as
\begin{align}
 H &= E_0 + \sum_{ij} f_{ij} \, \{a_i^\dagger a_j\}
+\frac{1}{2!^2}\sum_{ijkl} \Gamma_{ijkl} \, \{a_i^\dagger a_j^\dagger
a_l a_k\} \nonumber \\
&+\frac{1}{3!^2}\sum_{ijklmn} W_{ijklmn} \,
\{a_i^\dagger a_j^\dagger a_k^\dagger a_n a_m a_l\} \,,
\label{eq:normal-ordered_hamiltonian}
\end{align}
where the normal-ordered strings of creation and annihilation
operators obey $\langle\Phi|\{a^{\dagger}_i \cdots a_j\}|\Phi\rangle 
= 0$, and the normal-ordered 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-body terms are given by
\begin{align}
 E_0 &= \la \Phi | H | \Phi \ra = \sum_{i} T_{ii} \, n_i
+\frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} V^{(2)}_{ijij} \, n_i \, n_j \nonumber \\
&+ \frac{1}{6} \sum_{ijk} V^{(3)}_{ijkijk} \, n_i \, n_j \, n_k \,,
\label{eq:n-ordered_e0_ini} \\
f_{ij} &= T_{ij} + \sum_{k} V^{(2)}_{ikjk} \, n_k
+ \frac{1}{2} \sum_{kl} V^{(3)}_{ikljkl} \, n_k \, n_l \,, 
\label{eq:n-ordered_g_ini} \\
\Gamma_{ijkl} &= V^{(2)}_{ijkl} + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{m} V^{(3)}_{ijmklm}
\, n_m \,, \label{eq:n-ordered_gamma_ini} \\
W_{ijklmn} &= V^{(3)}_{ijklmn}.
\label{eq:n-ordered_w_ini}
\end{align}
Here, the initial $n$-body interactions are denoted by $V^{(n)}$, and
$n_i=\theta(\epsilon_{\rm F}-\epsilon_i)$ are occupation numbers in
the reference state $|\Phi \ra$, with Fermi energy $\epsilon_{\rm
F}$. It is evident from
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:n-ordered_e0_ini})--(\ref{eq:n-ordered_gamma_ini}) that
the normal-ordered terms, $E_0$, $f$ and $\Gamma$, include contributions
from the three-body interaction $V^{(3)}$ through sums over the
occupied single-particle states in the reference state
$|\Phi\rangle$. Therefore, truncating the in-medium SRG equations to
normal-ordered two-body operators, which we denote by IM-SRG(2),
will approximately evolve induced three- and higher-body interactions
through the nucleus-dependent 0-, 1-, and 2-body terms. As a preview,
we refer to Fig.~\ref{fig:he4_srg2.00} with the very promising
convergence of the $^4$He ground-state energy, which is comparable to
coupled-cluster results.

Using Wick's theorem to evaluate Eq.~(\ref{eq:fs_srg_flow_eqn}) with
$H(s) = E_0(s) + f(s)+ \Gamma(s)$ and $\eta = \eta^{(1)} + \eta^{(2)}$
truncated to normal-ordered two-body operators, one obtains the
coupled IM-SRG(2) flow equations (with $\bar{n}_i \equiv 1-n_i$):
\begin{align}
&\frac{dE_0}{ds} = \underline{\sum_{ij} \eta^{(1)}_{ij} f_{ji} \, (n_i-n_j)}
+\frac{1}{2} \sum_{ijkl} \eta^{(2)}_{ijkl} \Gamma_{klij} \,
n_i n_j \bar{n}_k \bar{n}_l ,
\label{eq:e0_flow} \\
&\frac{df_{12}}{ds} = \sum_{i} \Bigl[ \eta^{(1)}_{1i} f_{i2} 
+ (1 \leftrightarrow 2) \Bigr] \nonumber \\
&+\underline{ \sum_{ij} (n_i-n_j) (\eta^{(1)}_{ij} \, \Gamma_{j1i2}
- f_{ij} \, \eta^{(2)}_{j1i2}) }\nonumber \\
&+ \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ijk} \Bigl[ \eta^{(2)}_{k1ij} \Gamma_{ijk2} 
(n_i n_j \bar{n}_k + \bar{n}_i \bar{n}_j n_k) 
+ (1 \leftrightarrow 2) \Bigr] , \label{eq:1b_flow} \\[2mm]
&\frac{d\Gamma_{1234}}{ds} = \sum_{i} \Bigl[ (\underline{\eta^{(1)}_{1i} \,
\Gamma_{i234}} - f_{1i} \, \eta^{(2)}_{i234}) - (1 \leftrightarrow 2) \Bigr]
\nonumber \\
&- \sum_{i} \Bigl[ (\underline{\eta^{(1)}_{i3} \, \Gamma_{12i4}} - f_{i3} \,
\eta^{(2)}_{12i4}) - (3 \leftrightarrow 4) \Bigr]
\nonumber \\
&+ \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} \Bigl[ \eta^{(2)}_{12ij} \, \Gamma_{ij34}
(1-n_i-n_j)
+ (1,2 \leftrightarrow 3,4) \Bigr] \nonumber \\
&- \sum_{ij} (n_i - n_j) \Bigl[ (\eta^{(2)}_{j2i4} \Gamma_{i1j3}
- \eta^{(2)}_{i1j3} \Gamma_{j2i4}) - (1 \leftrightarrow 2) \Bigr] \,.
\label{eq:2b_flow}
\end{align}
The IM-SRG(2) equations exhibit important similarities to the CCSD
approximation of coupled-cluster theory. For instance, the commutator
form of the flow equations gives a fully connected structure in which
$H(s)$ has at least one contraction with $\eta$. Therefore, there are
no unlinked diagrams and the flow equations are size extensive.
Combined with the $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ scaling with the number of
single-particle orbitals, this makes the method well suited for
calculations of medium-mass nuclei. The IM-SRG is intrinsically
nonperturbative, where the flow equations,
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:e0_flow})--(\ref{eq:2b_flow}), build up nonperturbative
physics via the interference between the particle-particle and the two
particle-hole channels for $\Gamma$ and between the
two-particle--one-hole and two-hole--one-particle channels
for~$f$. The perturbative analysis reveals that the IM-SRG(2) energy
is third-order exact (as is the CCSD approximation) and that $f$ and
$\Gamma$ are second-order exact~\cite{imsrglong}. It also implies that
for calculations with harder interactions, the underlined terms in
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:e0_flow})--(\ref{eq:2b_flow}) should be excluded because
they produce higher-order contributions (with alternating signs) to
$E_0$ that are also generated by the inclusion of higher-body
normal-ordered interactions, $\eta^{(3)}$ and $W$, corresponding to
simultaneous $3p3h$ excitations. Because such triples excitations can
be sizable for hard potentials, the underlined terms in
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:e0_flow})--(\ref{eq:2b_flow}) should be omitted to better
preserve the partial cancellations that would occur against the
$[\eta^{(3)},W]$ contributions. This is consistent with the
observation in Fig.~\ref{fig:he4_srg2.00} that for soft potentials
our results are insensitive to the inclusion of these terms. Therefore
we define the IM-SRG(2) truncation without these terms for consistency.

In this initial study, we restrict our attention to the ground states
of doubly-magic nuclei and define $H^{\rm od}(s) = f^{\rm od}(s) +
\Gamma^{\rm od}(s)$, with
\begin{align}
f^{\rm od}(s) &= \sum_{ph} f_{ph}(s) \, \{a_p^\dagger a_h\} +
\text{H.c.} \,, \\
\Gamma^{\rm od}(s) &= \sum_{pp'hh'} \Gamma_{pp'hh'}(s) \, 
\{ a_{p}^\dagger a_{p'}^\dagger a_{h'} a_{h}\} + \text{H.c.} \,,
\end{align}
where $p,p'$ and $h,h'$ denote unoccupied (particle) and occupied
(hole) Hartree-Fock
orbitals, respectively. We consider two different cases for the
generator $\eta$. First, we take the Wegner choice 
$\eta^{\rm I}(s) = [H^{\rm d}(s),H^{\rm od}(s)]$. Second,
we follow White~\cite{white2002} and define
\begin{align}
\eta^{\rm II} &= \sum_{ph} \frac{f_{ph} \, \{a^\dagger_p a_h\}}{f_{p}-f_{h}
-\Gamma_{phph}} - \text{H.c.} \nonumber \\
&+ \sum_{pp'hh'} \frac{\Gamma_{pp'hh'} \, \{a^{\dagger}_p
a^{\dagger}_{p'} a_{h'} a_h\}}{f_{p}+f_{p'}-f_{h}-f_{h'} + A_{pp'hh'}} 
- \text{H.c.} \,,
\label{eq:gen_whi4}
\end{align}
where $A_{pp'hh'} = \Gamma_{pp'pp'} + \Gamma_{hh'hh'}
- \Gamma_{phph} - \Gamma_{p'h'p'h'} - \Gamma_{ph'ph'} - \Gamma_{p'hp'h}$
and $f_p\equiv f_{pp}$ (the $s$ dependence is
suppressed for simplicity). Both generators suppress off-diagonal
($1p1h$ and $2p2h$) couplings and drive
the Hamiltonian towards diagonal form,
\be
H(\infty) = E_0(\infty) + f^{\rm d}(\infty) + \Gamma^{\rm d}(\infty) \,,
\label{eq:evolved_H}
\ee
but White's generator ($\eta^{\rm II}$) is significantly more
efficient, because the flow equations are less stiff in this case and the
evaluation of $\eta$ at each step is significantly faster. The evolved
Hamiltonians using $\eta^{\rm I}$ and $\eta^{\rm II}$ are unitarily
equivalent if no truncations are made. Any differences in energy
eigenvalues therefore provide a measure of the truncation error
resulting from neglected three- and higher-body normal-ordered terms
in our calculations.

At the end of the flow, the reference state becomes the ground 
state of $H(\infty)$, with fully interacting ground-state energy
$E_0(\infty)$, and $|\Phi \ra$ decouples from the rest of the
Hilbert space ($1p1h, 2p2h, \ldots, ApAh$ sectors),
\be
QH(\infty)P = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad PH(\infty)Q = 0 \,,
\label{eq:decoupling}
\ee
where $P=| \Phi \ra \la \Phi |$ and $Q=1-P$. This decoupling
follows from the observation that all other normal-ordered couplings
annihilate the reference state, $[f^{\rm d}(s)+\Gamma^{\rm d}(s)]
|\Phi\rangle = 0$. Combined with $f^{\rm od}(\infty)$ and $\Gamma^{\rm
od}(\infty)$ being driven to zero, this implies the block-diagonal
structure of Eq.~(\ref{eq:decoupling}). The IM-SRG is very flexible
and alternative choices of $H^{\rm od}$ (and $\eta$) can be used to
target excited states, single-particle properties, and to construct
effective valence shell-model Hamiltonians and operators for
open-shell systems~\cite{kehrein2006,white2002}.


These calculations will in turn provide the basis for determining a as good as possible
ground state wave function. This wave function will in turn be used to define the quantum
mechanical density.  The density will be used to construct a density functional for quantum dots
using the adiabatic-connection method as described by Teale {\em et al} in J.~Chem.~Phys.~{\bf 130},
104111 (2009).  The results will be compared with existing density functionals for various quantum dots.

\section*{Progress plan and milestones}
The aims and progress plan of this thesis are as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item Fall 2012: Develop first a Hartree-Fock code for electrons trapped in a single harmonic oscillator  
in two dimensions.   This part entails developing a code for computing the Coulomb interaction
in two dimensions in the laboratory system.
\item The Hartree-Fock interaction is then used as input to the variational Monte Carlo code.
The results will be compared with large scale diagonalization and coupled-cluster
techniques for 2, 6, 12 and 20 
electrons in a single harmonic oscillator well.
\item Fall 2009: Write a code which solves the variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) problem
      for quantum dots. Both closed-core and open shell quantum dots will be studied. 
Construct  a Green's function Monte Carlo code
      based on the Variational Monte Carlo code. 
      The GFMC code receives as input the optimal 
      variational energy and wave function from the VMC calculation and solves
      in principle the Schr\"odinger equation exactly.
      The Slater determinant used in the VMC calculation includes also
      single-particle wave functions from Hartree-Fock calculations.
 \item Fall 2010: The obtained ground states will in turn be used to define a as exact as possible 
density functional for quantum dots
using the adiabatic-connection method. The density functional can in turn be used to model
systems with a large number of elctrons in quantum dots. Comparisons with a density functional derived from coupled-cluster methods will also be made in order to
test the validity of the Monte Carlo approach.
Possible applications are to mechanical studies of solar cells.
\end{itemize}
 


The thesis is expected to be handed in June 1 2013.
