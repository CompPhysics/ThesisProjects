	of topics and algorithmic approaches studied in this book. The next
	chapters concentrate on electronic structure calculations, presenting
	the Hartree-Fock and Density Functional formalisms, and band structure
	methods. Later chapters discuss molecular dynamics simulations and
	Monte Carlo methods in classical and quantum physics, with applications
	to condensed matter and particle field theories. Each chapter details
	the necessary fundamentals, describes the formation of a sample program,
	and includes problems that address related analytical and numerical
	issues. Useful appendices on numerical methods and random number
	generators are also included. This volume bridges the gap between
	undergraduate physics and computational research. It is an ideal
