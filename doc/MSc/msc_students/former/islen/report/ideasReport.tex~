During the timing of the mixed Python/C++ code, we only consider the time taking to make a variational loop, no the inicialization of objects. 

Figure () shows that the time spent for running an implementation depends on the kind of optimization made during compilation. A disadvantage of pure Python with respect to mixed Python/C++ is that no optimization of this kind can be applied, because of its scripting characteristic. The extension part, however can be compiled with differene kind of optimizations. 

Figure () compares plain Python against C++ code optimized with -O3 during compilation.

Figure () shows the case for higher number of Monte Carlo cycles, just for examinating if a higher Monte Carlo cycles some delays are observed.
