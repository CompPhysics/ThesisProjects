In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.}

ABSTRACT={A critical procedure in diagnosing atrial fibrillation is the creation of electro-anatomic activation maps. Current methods generate these mappings from interpolation using a few sparse data points recorded inside the atria; they neither include prior knowledge of the underlying physics nor uncertainty of these recordings. Here we propose a physics-informed neural network for cardiac activation mapping that accounts for the underlying wave propagation dynamics and we quantify the epistemic uncertainty associated with these predictions. These uncertainty estimates not only allow us to quantify the predictive error of the neural network, but also help to reduce it by judiciously selecting new informative measurement locations via active learning. We illustrate the potential of our approach using a synthetic benchmark problem and a personalized electrophysiology model of the left atrium. We show that our new method outperforms linear interpolation and Gaussian process regression for the benchmark problem and linear interpolation at clinical densities for the left atrium. In both cases, the active learning algorithm achieves lower error levels than random allocation. Our findings open the door toward physics-based electro-anatomic mapping with the ultimate goals to reduce procedural time and improve diagnostic predictability for patients affected by atrial fibrillation.

ABSTRACT={Accurately inferring underlying electrophysiological (EP) tissue properties from action potential recordings is expected to be clinically useful in the diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. It is, however, notoriously difficult to perform. We present EP-PINNs (Physics Informed Neural Networks), a novel tool for accurate action potential simulation and EP parameter estimation from sparse amounts of EP data. We demonstrate, using 1D and 2D in silico data, how EP-PINNs are able to reconstruct the spatio-temporal evolution of action potentials, whilst predicting parameters related to action potential duration (APD), excitability and diffusion coefficients. EP-PINNs are additionally able to identify heterogeneities in EP properties, making them potentially useful for the detection of fibrosis and other localised pathology linked to arrhythmias. Finally, we show EP-PINNs effectiveness on biological in vitro preparations, by characterising the effect of anti-arrhythmic drugs on APD using optical mapping data. EP-PINNs are a promising clinical tool for the characterisation and potential treatment guidance of arrhythmias.}

    abstract = { Cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in the more economically developed countries. Ventricular tachycardia associated with myocardial infarct is a prominent cause of cardiac arrest. Ventricular arrhythmias occur in 3 phases of infarction: during the ischemic event, during the healing phase, and after the scar matures. Mechanisms of arrhythmias in these phases are distinct. This review focuses on arrhythmia mechanisms for ventricular tachycardia in mature myocardial scar. Available data have shown that postinfarct ventricular tachycardia is a reentrant arrhythmia occurring in circuits found in the surviving myocardial strands that traverse the scar. Electrical conduction follows a zigzag course through that area. Conduction velocity is impaired by decreased gap junction density and impaired myocyte excitability. Enhanced sympathetic tone decreases action potential duration and increases sarcoplasmic reticular calcium leak and triggered activity. These elements of the ventricular tachycardia mechanism are found diffusely throughout scar. A distinct myocyte repolarization pattern is unique to the ventricular tachycardia circuit, setting up conditions for classical reentry. Our understanding of ventricular tachycardia mechanisms continues to evolve as new data become available. The ultimate use of this information would be the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics to reliably identify at-risk patients and prevent their ventricular arrhythmias. }

abstract = {An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives. Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

  abstract = 	 {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}
