\section{The Electron Gas}

In this chapter, we will review central aspects of the electron gas and prior results in the literature. 

We will derive the energy expressions, the fock matrix, the antisymmetric interaction and discuss periodicity.

We will further review the work of contributors to this field, and present their results for later comparisons.
