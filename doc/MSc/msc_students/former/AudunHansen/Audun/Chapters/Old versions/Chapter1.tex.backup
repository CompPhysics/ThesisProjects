\section{Many Body Quantum Theory}

Many Body Quantum Theory is the framework which to date best describes and predicts phenomenas relating to interacting quantum system. The main body of theory was developed by physicists such as Fermi, Pauli and Dirac in the late 1920s. While the Davisson-Germer electron diffraction experiment confirmed the particle wave duality of matter in 1927 \cite{Giuliani2005} and the discovery of half integer spin was made by Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck in 1925 \cite{Giuliani2005}, these results found their rationale in the theoretical work of Pauli, Fermi and Dirac \cite{Giuliani2005}. Dirac introduced the \emph{Second Quantization Formalism} in 1927 \cite{ShavittBartlett2009}.

Important contributions has been made continually over the years by others. Feynman introduced the diagrammatic formalism in 1949 \cite{ShavittBartlett2009}, just prior to the advent of many-body perturbation theory as introduced by Brueckner and Levinson (1955) \cite{ShavittBartlett2009}. In the mid 1950's, groundbreaking work on the coupled cluster method was performed by by nuclear physicists Coester and Kümmel. \cite{Kummel2001}

The theory builds on fundamental quantum mechanics with the addition of some further assumptions, a number of more or less overlapping formalisms, and a number of methods for solving or approximating a solution to the many-body schrodinger equation.

Because of the theory`s ability to make highly accurate predictions for quantum systems using only first principles (ab initio), it has also become a central aspect of modern chemistry. The theory covers a broad array of phenomenas on the quantum scale, ranging from hadrons to molecules, solids and periodic systems, material science and life science. 

Although the fundamental physics of the theory has remained mostly unchanged since the 1920s, it is a field in continual developement. Computers evolves gradually to enable more comprehensive calculations, and methodological advancements yields new insights and perspectives on the underlying physics.

The theory offers a range of methods for approximating energies and properties of systems. When choosing which method to utilize, one has to consider the tradeoffs between performance and accuracy. While some methods may in principle give you the exact solution, they may have computational requirements beyond what is currently possible. By these considerations, many currently consider the CCSD(T) the "gold standard" of ab initio techniques, as it is both efficient and highly accurate \cite{NEED referebce}.

In the following sections we will briefly review the theory and notation used in the rest of this thesis. For a more extensive introduction, the reader is referred to one of the many excellent books on the subject. \ref{} [list a lot of relevant books here]

%	The Fundamental postulates of Quantum Mechanics
%-----------------------------------
\section{The Postulates of Quantum Mechanics}

At the heart of quantum mechanics lies some fundamental postulates (or assumptions). We will here briefly state these in no particular order.

\paragraph{(1) The Wave Function}
The state of a quantum mechanical system is fully specified in time and space by a wavefunction $\vert \Psi(x,t) \rangle$. Born's Statistical Interpretation \cite{Griffiths2005} suggests that the probability of finding the system in the volume element $d\tau$ at time $t$ is defined by $\Psi(x,t)^* \Psi(x,t) d\tau$. Another important property is that the wavefunction should be normalized to 1 in the full occupied space \cite{Griffiths2005}:

$$ \int_\Omega \Psi(x,t)^* \Psi(x,t) d\tau = 1 $$

\paragraph{(2) Observables} For any measurable quantity, such as energy, momentum, or spin, there exists an corresponding linear, Hermitean operator. Such operators are commonly denoted with a hat; $\hat{O}$

\paragraph{(3) Measurement} A measurement of any observables $\hat{A}$ on the system, will result in a value $a$, corresponding to the eigenvalues of the equation

$$ \hat{A} \Psi = a \Psi $$

\paragraph{(4) Average measurement} For a system in the state $\Psi$, we may find the average measurement of $\hat{A}$ by

 $$ \int_{\Omega} \Psi(x,t)^* \hat{A} \Psi(x,t) d\tau \equiv \langle  \Psi \vert  \hat{A} \vert \Psi \rangle  =  \langle{ A} \rangle$$

The average measurement is \emph{not the most likely result}, merely the average of a multitude of measurements on identical systems. 

\paragraph{(5) Time evolution} The system will evolve in time in accordance with the time independent Schrödinger equation

\begin{equation}
\hat{H} \vert \Psi(x,t) \rangle = i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \vert \Psi(x,t) \rangle
\label{eqn:tisl}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{(6) The Pauli Exclusion Principle} No two indistinguishable \emph{fermions} may occupy the same quantum state. 

While not all textbooks lists The Pauli Exclusion Principle as a separate postulate, it is a well known experimental fact from which no exempt has been found. \cite{??} For our purpose, most of this thesis does rely on the Pauli Principle being true, so for all intents and purposes we may as well take it to be a fundamental postulate.

%	The many body wavefunction
%-----------------------------------

\subsection{The Many Body Wavefunction}
A single particle may in isolation be completely described by a wavefunction in Hilbert space. We will refer to this SP (single particle) state by

$$ \psi(\bold{x}) $$

where $\bold{x}$ now contains all the relevant quantum numbers (including spin).

In the presence of other particles it will make sense to define a wavefunction that describes the system as a whole $\Psi$, and it is reasonable to assume that this function relies on each constituent SP state. For a system of $N$ particles, we then have

\begin{equation}
\Psi \equiv \Psi(\psi_0(\bold{x}_0), \psi_1(\bold{x}_1), \psi_2(\bold{x}_2) ... \psi_N(\bold{x}_N)) 
\label{eqn:tisldef}
\end{equation}

Since each SP state have an associated Hilbert space, the systems state space will be a tensor product of each SP state space

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}_0 \otimes \mathcal{H}_1 \otimes \mathcal{H}_2 \otimes ...  \otimes \mathcal{H}_N
\label{eqn:systemspace}
\end{equation}

It is however possible for a subspace of the above to be sufficient.

This may lead us to guess that the systems wavefunction is something like

\begin{equation}
\Psi_h  = \psi_0 \otimes \psi_1 \otimes ...  \otimes \psi_N = \psi_0(\bold{x}_0) \psi_1(\bold{x}_1) ... \psi_N(\bold{x}_N)
\label{eqn:hartreeprod}
\end{equation}

The subscript $h$ denotes that the above product is the so called \emph{hartree product} or \emph{-function}. 

\paragraph{Antisymmetry}

The Hartree product lacks one important feature that is needed to properly describe fermionic systems, namely the antisymmetrization described in postulate 6 in the previous subsection. The Hartree product is \emph{completely uncorrelated}, meaning that the probability of finding fermions simultaneously at locations $x_0,x_1,...$ is simply

$$|\psi_i(x_0)\psi_j(x_1)...|^2 dx_0 dx_1 ... = |\psi_i(x_0)|^2 dx_0 |\psi_j(x_1)|^2 dx_2 ...$$

This is just the product of each constituent particle wavefunction squared. The motion of these particles is in effect independent of each other.

From experiment, we know that fermions are identical particles with half integer spin. \cite{} Being *identical* is equivalent to being experimentally *indistinguishable*. This holds true unless some special preparation of the fermions is made, such as giving them opposite momentum. 

Although it doesn't immediately solve the antisymmetrization issues, we may therefore assume that each way of permuting the Hartree function is an equally valid representation of the system, so that also a linear combination of such permuted Hartree products is a valid representation of the system:

\begin{equation}
 \Psi_p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \sum_{\pi}^{N!} \hat{P}_{\pi} \Psi_h
\label{eqn:hartreeperm}
\end{equation}

The subscript $p$ refers to the permutations, $N$ is here a normalizing constand, and the operator $\hat{P}_{\pi}$ is the permutation operator, performing all $N!$ possible permutations of the Hartree product. 

The Pauli Exclusion Principle is an interpretation of experimental facts, such as the pairing tendency of electrons, and the relation between stability and particle count in a variety of systems. It is commonly stated as \emph{no two indistinguishable fermions may occupy the same quantum state}. When applied on the permuted Hartree function, we see that this principle does not apply in its current form.

To mend this shortcoming of the permuted Hartree function we require that interchanging two particles should also change the sign of the resulting function. Thus, an odd number of permutations should result in a sign change, while an even number of permutations should not. We may express this by

\begin{equation}
 \Psi_{SD} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \sum_{\pi}^{N!} \hat{P}_{\pi} (-)^{n(\pi)}\Psi_h \equiv \sqrt{N!} \mathcal{A} \Psi_h
\label{eqn:slaterdet}
\end{equation}

The subscript $SD$ now denotes the Slater determinant, which from here on will be referred to as simply the SD. The antisymmetrizer $\mathcal{A}$ is introduced to ease upcoming manipulations. Another common representation of the SD is 

\begin{equation}
\Psi_{SD} (\mathbf{x_1},\mathbf{x_2},...,\mathbf{x_N}) =  \
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
 \begin{vmatrix}
  \psi_1(\mathbf{x_1}) & \psi_2(\mathbf{x_1}) & \cdots & \psi_N(\mathbf{x_1}) \\
  \psi_1(\mathbf{x_2}) & \psi_2(\mathbf{x_2}) & \cdots & \psi_N(\mathbf{x_2}) \\
  \vdots               & \vdots               & \ddots & \vdots               \\
  \psi_1(\mathbf{x_N}) & \psi_2(\mathbf{x_N}) & \cdots & \psi_N(\mathbf{x_N}) \\
 \end{vmatrix} 
\label{eqn:slaterlinalg}
\end{equation}

%	The Aim of Many Body Quantum Theory
%-----------------------------------

\subsection{The Aim of Many Body Quantum Theory}

At this point, we should note that while the SD fulfills the criterias laid out so far, we have still not defined the SP states. For the SD to fullfill the time independent Schrödinger equation, so must its constituent SP states. 

Depending on the form of the Hamiltonian in the Schrödinger equation, we may or may not have some idea of the form of the SP states. 

Consider for example a number of interacting fermions in a common potential. When solving the equivalent one body problem, one typically obtains a set of wavefunctions fullfilling the Schrödinger equation, where each constituent function corresponds to energy states. The number of states may be infinite. By letting this set of states populate the SD we may construct an infinite number of SD's, in effect spanning the full state space defined in \ref{eqn:systemspace}.

This is valid as long as it makes sense to define an unperturbed hamiltonian $\hat{H}_0$ where no correlation occurs. (is this correct??)

This is in essence the aim of Many Body Quantum Theory: we seek the set of SD's that gives the most accurate representation of the system's wavefunction. 

To obtain such a set we may choose a variety of paths, but common to all is the fact that the mathematical framework used so far would prove very tedious in deriving the upcoming expressions. We will therefore need to utilize the framework commonly called \emph{second quantization} or \emph{the number representation}, and for even more simplicity we will extend this to diagrammatic notation.

%-----------------------------------

\section{Second Quantization}

\paragraph{A brief review} In this section we will briefly review second quantized operators, Wicks theorem, referance states ...

When choosing the SP states to populate the SD, we will normally choose from a set of states that solves the corresponding one body problem. Each of these states will have an energy eigenvalue in the one body problem. Because of the Pauli Exclusions Principle, any state may only occur once in the Hartree product, since multiple identical functions will cause the SD to cancel. 

For a collection of $N$ completely non interacting identical fermions in a common potential, it then makes sense to define a energy level corresponding to the distribution of states where the $N$ lowest energy states is occupied. The energy of the most excited state is called the Fermi Energy, while the SD where all states below the Fermi Energy is occupied is called the Fermi Vacuum. 

We may also define a state where no states is occupied. 

When comparing the number of particles to the energy levels corresponding to the SP states, we
