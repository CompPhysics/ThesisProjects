We investigate how the coupled cluster method at the level of doubles
and triples amplitudes contributes to the ground state energy of the
homogeneous electron gas. We present and derive the formalism and
equations needed, and describe in detail how two independent and
conceptually differing computational schemes may be implemented
efficiently for the system uner study. We finally perform numerous
calculations for the infinite electron gas, investigate how the
gradual inclusion of more diagrams leading up to the full coupled
cluster doubles triples (CCDT) method affects the energy, and we
estimate the energy in the thermodynamical limit by extrapolating
results from large scale computations. In order to check all
equations, we have also developed a software which produces all
equations needed at a given level of truncation of coupled cluster
theory. This allows for efficient benchmarking of equations as well as
codes for implementing various conributions to the theory.}

The content of this thesis relies heavily on the work of others. While
the many physicist who paved way for this work is far too many to each
be mentioned by name, I would like to extend my appreciation of them
all. Without their valuable contributions, we may still have been
standing paralyzed when faced with the discrete nature of the
universe. After years as a student of physics, I'm more impressed and
perplexed than ever by the fact that someone could come up with the
concepts and formalism of quantum mechanics.

Of the more direct contributions to this thesis, I wish to acknowledge
the many made by my advisor, prof. Morten Hjorth-Jensen. His valuable
and deep insight into many-body theory as well as the broader context
of physics has been extremely helpful. His liberal approach to
guidance has allowed me to also explore some of my own ideas and paths
- even some detours - which I suspect may have resulted in some more
confidence from my part when dealing with such matters as science. The
time spent under his supervision at Michigan State University was very
rewarding and productive.

Another direct contributor to this thesis is Gustav Baardsen, ph.d. In
large parts, this thesis is founded on his doctoral thesis
\emph{Coupled-cluster theory for infinite matter}
\cite{Baardsen2014}. He has also been very helpful in supplying me
with his code, as well as very extensive datasets for comparison with
my own.

It has also been of great help to be part of the Computational Physics
group at the University of Oslo. Everything from minor discussions on
which libraries to utilize or how to install drivers for the printer,
to more central issues as how to compile Armadillo on the Abel cluster
(Thank you Jørgen Høgberget and Svenn-Arne Dragly) have been extremely
valuable in my work. I am proud to be a member of this highly
competent group.

Finally I wish to thank my family: my dear Kine for her care,
understanding and dedication, as well as our two sons Erik and Alfred
for allowing me to sleep after late nights working on this project.

As mentioned, some of the calculations in this thesis was performed on
the Abel Cluster, owned by the University of Oslo and the Norwegian
metacenter for High Performance Computing (NOTUR), and operated by the
Department for Research Computing at USIT, the University of Oslo
IT-department. \cite{abel} I am grateful for being trusted with access
to these overwhelming resources.  }
