      "A fermi gas is a system where a large, possibly infinite, number of fermions occupy a space. The interaction between the fermions may range from none, as in the case of the ideal fermi gas, to a fully interacting gas.\n",

      "A special case of the fermi gas is the homogenous electron gas. This will be our first subject of study. In this case we have an infinite number of uniformly distributed electrons, interacting with each other through coulomb repulsion. The system as a whole has a net zero overall charge, since the charge of the electrons is cancelled by a uniformly distributed positive background charge.\n",
