abstract = {The model periodic Coulomb interaction (Williamson et al 1997 Phys. Rev. B 55 R4851) is a replacement for the Ewald sum, developed to reduce finite-size errors in the simulation of extended 3D systems. We investigate the generalization of this technique to quasi-2D systems; we show through testing in quantum Monte Carlo simulations that while the new interaction reduces the calculation time dramatically it does not reduce finite-size errors. We explain this by analysing the finite-size errors generated when using the Ewald sum.},

abstract = {Using the homogeneous electron gas (HEG) as a model, we investigate the sources of error in the "initiator" adaptation to full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (i-FCIQMC), with a view to accelerating convergence. In particular, we find that the fixed-shift phase, where the walker number is allowed to grow slowly, can be used to effectively assess stochastic and initiator error. Using this approach we provide simple explanations for the internal parameters of an i-FCIQMC simulation. We exploit the consistent basis sets and adjustable correlation strength of the HEG to analyze properties of the algorithm, and present finite basis benchmark energies for N = 14 over a range of densities 0.5 ≤ r(s) ≤ 5.0 a.u. A single-point extrapolation scheme is introduced to produce complete basis energies for 14, 38, and 54 electrons. It is empirically found that, in the weakly correlated regime, the computational cost scales linearly with the plane wave basis set size, which is justifiable on physical grounds. We expect the fixed-shift strategy to reduce the computational cost of many i-FCIQMC calculations of weakly correlated systems. In addition, we provide benchmarks for the electron gas, to be used by other quantum chemical methods in exploring periodic solid state systems.},

abstract = {A new algorithm is presented for the calculation of the ladder-type term of the CCSD equations using two-electron integrals in atomic orbital (AO) basis. The method is based on an orbital grouping scheme which results in an optimal partitioning of the AO integral matrix into sparse and dense blocks allowing efficient matrix multiplication. Carefully chosen numerical tests have been performed to analyze the performance of all aspects of the new algorithm. It is shown that the suggested scheme allows an efficient utilization of modern highly parallel architectures and devices in CCSD calculations. Details of the implementation in the development version of CFOUR quantum chemical program package are also presented.},

abstract = {Using the finite simulation-cell homogeneous electron gas (HEG) as a model, we investigate the convergence of the correlation energy to the complete basis set (CBS) limit in methods utilising plane-wave wavefunction expansions. Simple analytic and numerical results from second-order M\{$\backslash$o\}ller-Plesset theory (MP2) suggest a 1/M decay of the basis-set incompleteness error where M is the number of plane waves used in the calculation, allowing for straightforward extrapolation to the CBS limit. As we shall show, the choice of basis set truncation when constructing many-electron wavefunctions is far from obvious, and here we propose several alternatives based on the momentum transfer vector, which greatly improve the rate of convergence. This is demonstrated for a variety of wavefunction methods, from MP2 to coupled-cluster doubles theory (CCD) and the random-phase approximation plus second-order screened exchange (RPA+SOSEX). Finite basis-set energies are presented for these methods and compared with exact benchmarks. A transformation can map the orbitals of a general solid state system onto the HEG plane wave basis and thereby allow application of these methods to more realistic physical problems.},

The equations for the one- and two-body cluster amplitudes are presented in a factorized form that leads to an efficient numerical implementation. We employ low-momentum two- and three-nucleon interactions and calculate the binding energy of He-4. The results show that the main contribution of the three-nucleon interaction stems from its density-dependent zero-, one-, and two-body terms that result from the normal ordering of the Hamiltonian in coupled-cluster theory. The residual three-body terms that remain after normal ordering can be neglected.},

Using the Hartree-Fock wave function as a reference, perturbative (M\o ller-Plesset) and coupled cluster theories are used to study the uniform electron gas model. Our findings suggest that nonperturbative coupled cluster theories are acceptable for modeling electronic interactions in metals while perturbative coupled cluster theories are not. Using screened interactions, we propose a simple modification to the widely used coupled cluster singles and doubles plus perturbative triples method that lifts the divergent behavior and is shown to give very accurate correlation energies for the homogeneous electron gas.},

We demonstrate that our parallel SpGEMM methods, which use two-dimensional block data distributions with serial hypersparse kernels, are indeed highly flexible, scalable, and memory-efficient in the general case. This algorithm is the first to yield increasing speedup to an unbounded number of processors; our experiments show scaling up to thousands of processors in a variety of test scenarios.},
