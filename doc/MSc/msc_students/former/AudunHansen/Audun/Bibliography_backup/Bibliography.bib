We investigate the generalization of this technique to quasi-2D systems; we show through testing in quantum Monte Carlo simulations that while the new interaction reduces the calculation time dramatically it does not reduce finite-size errors. We explain this by analysing the finite-size errors generated when using the Ewald sum.},

abstract = {Using the homogeneous electron gas (HEG) as a model, we investigate the sources of error in the "initiator" adaptation to full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (i-FCIQMC), with a view to accelerating convergence. In particular, we find that the fixed-shift phase, where the walker number is allowed to grow slowly, can be used to effectively assess stochastic and initiator error. Using this approach we provide simple explanations for the internal parameters of an i-FCIQMC simulation. We exploit the consistent basis sets and adjustable correlation strength of the HEG to analyze properties of the algorithm, and present finite basis benchmark energies for N = 14 over a range of densities 0.5 $\leq$ r(s) $\leq$ 5.0 a.u. A single-point extrapolation scheme is introduced to produce complete basis energies for 14, 38, and 54 electrons. It is empirically found that, in the weakly correlated regime, the computational cost scales linearly with the plane wave basis set size, which is justifiable on physical grounds. We expect the fixed-shift strategy to reduce the computational cost of many i-FCIQMC calculations of weakly correlated systems. In addition, we provide benchmarks for the electron gas, to be used by other quantum chemical methods in exploring periodic solid state systems.},

abstract = {Using the finite simulation-cell homogeneous electron gas (HEG) as a model, we investigate the convergence of the correlation energy to the complete basis set (CBS) limit in methods utilising plane-wave wavefunction expansions. Simple analytic and numerical results from second-order M\{$\backslash$o\}ller-Plesset theory (MP2) suggest a 1/M decay of the basis-set incompleteness error where M is the number of plane waves used in the calculation, allowing for straightforward extrapolation to the CBS limit. As we shall show, the choice of basis set truncation when constructing many-electron wavefunctions is far from obvious, and here we propose several alternatives based on the momentum transfer vector, which greatly improve the rate of convergence. This is demonstrated for a variety of wavefunction methods, from MP2 to coupled-cluster doubles theory (CCD) and the random-phase approximation plus second-order screened exchange (RPA+SOSEX). Finite basis-set energies are presented for these methods and compared with exact benchmarks. A transformation can map the orbitals of a general solid state system onto the HEG plane wave basis and thereby allow application of these methods to more realistic physical problems.},

Using the Hartree-Fock wave function as a reference, perturbative (M\o ller-Plesset) and coupled cluster theories are used to study the uniform electron gas model. Our findings suggest that nonperturbative coupled cluster theories are acceptable for modeling electronic interactions in metals while perturbative coupled cluster theories are not.

Carefully chosen numerical tests have been performed to analyze the performance of all aspects of the new algorithm. It is shown that the suggested scheme allows an efficient utilization of modern highly parallel architectures and devices in CCSD calculations.

	abstract = {An exact formal solution is obtained to the problem of a system of fermions in interaction. This solution is expressed in a form which avoids the problem of unlinked clusters in many-body theory. The technique of Feynman graphs is used to derive the series and to define linked terms. The graphs are those appropriate to a system of many fermions and are used to give a new derivation of the Hartree-Fock and Brueckner methods for this problem.},

  abstract={We report variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo ground-state energies of the three-dimensional electron gas using a model periodic Coulomb interaction and backflow corrections for N = 54, 102, 178, and 226 electrons. We remove finite-size effects by extrapolation and we find lower energies than previously reported. Using the Hellman–Feynman operator sampling method introduced in Gaudoin and Pitarke (2007 Phys. Rev. Lett. 99 126406), we compute accurately, within the fixed-node approximation, the separate kinetic and interaction contributions to the total ground-state energy. The difference between the interaction energies obtained from the original Slater-determinant nodes and the backflow-displaced nodes is found to be considerably larger than the difference between the corresponding kinetic energies.}
