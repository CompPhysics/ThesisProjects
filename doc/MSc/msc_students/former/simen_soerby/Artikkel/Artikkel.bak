\begin{abstract}

In later years, computational perspectives have become essential parts in several of the University of Oslo's natural science studies. In this paper I discuss some main findings from a qualitative study of the computational perspectives' impact on the students' work with their first course in physics -- mechanics -- and their learning and meaning making of its contents. Discussions relating to the students' learning of physics are based on the sociocultural theory, which originates in Vygotsky and Bakhtin, and subsequent physics didactics research. Results imply that the computational assignments' greatest challenge is their combined use of students' knowledge from earlier separated contexts. Making use of informatics, numerical and analytical mathematics and conceptual understanding of physics in one big package, appears as a clear challenge for the students. A lack of awareness considering the limitations of physical modeling is also observed. I argue in favor of helping the students create an awareness concerning their use of sufficient knowledge and system of conception, or ``tool set'', for the different tasks at hand. They need help creating a plan for their modeling and to become aware of its limits. In light of this, I propose a specific and dialogic text as grounds for the exercises, in which stress is laid on clarification and elaboration, to be of potential great aid for the students.

\section{Introduction}

Both computers and the great span in numerical methods for mathematical computations have gradually evolved due to scientific research with its endless stream of new questions and technology's seemingly unstoppable advancements. This development has in turn caused significant changes in a physicists expected tasks in his or her line of work, be it either in research or industry. As a consequence, computational perspectives have become essential parts in several of the University of Oslo's natural science studies, including the Physics, Astronomy and Meteorology branch, which is the subject of this paper. These changes are the results of some enthusiastic people working with a project called Computers in Science Education (CSE) at the University of Oslo.\cite{CMA_CSE} The goal of this project is to develop a unified computational perspective on undergraduate teaching programs across course and departmental boundaries.

The students will in their first semester at the University gain important insight in analytical and numerical mathematics, as well as the programming language Python. The knowledge and skills they build up during this semester is fundamental for working with courses further up in the system. For the physics students in particular, the first semester will lay the foundation for modeling physical systems and phenomena with computational perspectives in their second semester and their first course in physics: mechanics. Computational perspectives are integral parts of this course and stands side by side with traditional physics theory. To accomplish this, new course material has been developed -- including textbook material and exercises -- which incorporates these new aspects as a natural part of the curriculum. These new exercises involve writing program codes in python to simulate a broad range of physical systems on the computer. 

Since the CSE-project has long since started to bear fruits, it was made possible in 2008/2009 to carry out a study on how these new aspects impacts the students work with and learning of physics. The study was designed to gain insight into the students work and examine whether or not the students are ready to face the challenges they meet in the mechanics course with regards to it's computational perspectives after their first semester. Do the assignments' computational parts arrange for a good way of learning physics? What challenges might the students be facing regarding the learning and meaning making of the physics theory in light of introducing the computational aspects?

\section{A course in mechanics with computational perspectives}

In their second semester course in mechanics, the students meet a lot of different assignments which incorporates computational perspectives. In this section, I will first describe one of the assignments the students were set to do. Afterwards, I will show how the students generally, and most basically, are supposed to deal with the computational parts of such assignments using Euler's method.

\subsection{An example of a student assignment}

The assignment regards a ball with mass $m$ in a spring moving in a vertical plane -- an elastic pendulum motion. The force on the rope is described with a spring model with spring constant $k$ and equilibrium length $L$. The assignment starts out with asking the students to draw a free-body diagram and to show that the forces in play can be written as
\begin{equation}
 \sum \vec F = -mg \hat j - k(r-L) \frac{\vec r}{r}, \nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\vec r$ determines the position of the ball and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.

Some more traditional exercises are given, like calculating analytically what the position will be if the velocity is zero, before a program code to describe the motion of the ball is asked for. The challenge for the students is to decompose the forces and to implement them into the program code correctly. When the program is up and going, the students are asked to experiment with the spring constant, $k$, and write down what they think is the limitation of this modeling approach.

\subsection{Solving ordinary differential equations with Euler's method}

After their first semester, the students should know how to use Euler's method to approximate the solutions to first order ordinary differential equations on the form $y'(t) = f(t,y(t))$. Euler's method for solving this equation is (is it necessary with a citation?)
\begin{align}
 y(t+h) &= y(t) + y'(t) \cdot h \nonumber \\
	&= y(t) + f(t,y(t)) \cdot h \nonumber,
\end{align}
\noindent where $h$ is the discrete step length. 

A typical physics problem the students meet in their second semester mechanics course, can be described with Newton's 2. law:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:newton}
a(t) = x''(t) = \frac{1}{m} \sum F(t,x(t),v(t)) \nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent This equation is an ordinary differential equation of \textit{second order}. To use Euler's method, we must first introduce the variable $v(t)$ with the relation $v(t) = x'(t)$ and get the following set of \textit{coupled first order} differential equations.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
 v'(t) &= \frac{1}{m} \sum F(t,x(t),v(t)) \nonumber\\
 x'(t) &= v(t) \nonumber
\end{align}
\end{subequations} 
\noindent Using Euler's method, we can approximate the solutions to these equations in the following way:
\noindent 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  v(t+h) &= v(t) + \frac{1}{m}\sum F(t,x(t),v(t)) \cdot h \nonumber \\
  x(t+h) &= x(t) + v(t) \cdot h \nonumber
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

In the students' program code, after declaring constants, arrays (with length $n$) and initial conditions, the essential code for computing the approximated solution can be seen below. Here, as we run through the arrays, the sum of forces divided by mass is calculated in advance (and recognized as $a$) to ease readability. Also, the more common notation of $dt$ is used for the step length. The elapsed time is updated in the end of each step.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
   for i in range (n-1):
       a[i] = F(t[i],x[i],v[i])/m
       v[i+1] = v[i] + a[i] * dt
       x[i+1] = x[i] + v[i] * dt
       t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

\noindent All physical systems that can be described with a second order ODE, can be approximated with this method. The only variables that differs from system to system is the forces in play, and consequently the only basic difference from code to code is the function containing these forces.


\section{Theoretical framework}

\subsection{The sociocultural theory of learning and development}

The sociocultural theory emphasize that knowledge is constructed through social interaction and in a specific context, not primarily through individual processes. Knowledge is consequently situated in a historical and cultural context. The construction of knowledge involves mediation of concepts on a social plane, which can thereby be internalized by the individual.\cite{Wertsch:1985} Lev Vygotsky is widely recognized for introducing these ideas along with, what he calls, the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) in school children's learning and development.\cite{Vygotsky:1978} The ZPD, as defined by Vygotsky himself, \textit{is the distance between the actual development level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers}. With guidance and collaboration being viewed as essential for learning and development, the act of imitation should as a consequence be regarded as an active process in which meaning and understanding is being constructed. When imitating someone else, the student finds himself within his ZPD on his way of mastering the task at hand on his own.

Regarding the social mediation of concepts, Vygotsky made a clear distinction between two types: \textit{spontaneous} and \textit{scientific}.\cite{Vygotsky:1986} Spontaneous concepts are characterized by having grounds in everyday experience and being unsystematic and strongly bound to context. Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are decontextualized and organized in a logic and hierarchic fashion. The latter are also called ``academic concepts'', i.e. concepts found in any school setting. Even though spontaneous and scientific concepts are fundamentally different in the way we encounter and learn them, they are closely related to each other in the development of concept formation: Spontaneous concepts have a development direction ``upward'' towards greater abstractness and, at the same time, they arrange for establishing scientific concepts in their ``downward'' development toward greater concreteness. The challenge teachers face is to hinder the spontaneous concepts from being overly bound to specific contexts, and at the same time hinder the scientific concepts from appearing isolated and fragmented.

When we now turn to the works of Mikhail Bakhtin, we'll take a deeper dive into \textit{how} the social mediation of concepts might take place. The main means for this process is oral or written discourse. Bakhtin pointed out that any discourse, or interplay of \textit{voices}, consists of addressed \textit{utterances} which are composed with grounds in a \textit{social language}.\cite{Wertsch:1991} A social language can be viewed as the basis of values and knowledge for the composition of the utterance; a specific point of view determined by one's social position, e.g. one's profession or other social affiliation. On the other hand, what Bakhtin refers to as ``voice'' should be compared with one's personality or consciousness. One's voice exists fundamentally in a social milieu and cannot be isolated from other voices. This applies for the utterance as well, however it is also being \textit{addressed}; it carries a natural expectance of a response. This can very well be an expectance of no response at all. In such a case, the utterance is regarded as \textit{authoritative}. An authoritative utterance implies that it's meaning is static, it is fixed once and for all and does not encourage an interanimation of voices. The opposite of an authoritative utterance is a \textit{dialogic} utterance. In this case, the meaning is not fixed and static, but open -- it seeks new contexts to broaden its meaning. The number of such contexts is limited by the number of and heterogeneity of the voices that has the opportunity to participate in the discourse. The more contexts one can relate to a concept, and consequently the more associations one can make to it, the easier it's meaning might be to grasp.\cite{Kubli:2005} To be meaningful or of a meaning making character, the discourse should contain multiple voices which engage each other dialogically; it should strive for multivoicedness, or \textit{polyphony}, and be dialogic in nature.

Mortimer \& Scott follows the lead of Jon Ogborn and colleagues and compare, with grounds in Vygotskys view on concept formation, learning of a school subject with \textit{building up its scientific story}.\cite{Mortimer:2003,Ogborn:1996} With regards to Bakhtin, the scientific story of physics is viewed as the physics theory expressed in terms of the ideas and conventions of the school science social language. Teaching of physics then becomes the equivalent of ``telling'' the story in its social language in a convincing way for the student, i.e. engaging the students everyday views in a topic area and developing convincing lines of argument through an interactive and dialogic dialogue.


\subsection{A conceptual understanding of physics}

A well known phenomenon is how the students are able to solve assignments and doing well in tests without being able to show the ``correct understanding'' of the physics theory.\cite{Hestenes:1992} The students might either be lacking sufficient knowledge in a topic area or hold a faulty understanding from a scientific point of view, but still answer correctly in tests. While the first case is likely the result of rote memorization, the latter, often labeled as common sense concepts or \textit{misconceptions}, is the results of the students' having developed an individual (and faulty) understanding of the physics theory. The problem with misconceptions is that they are not arbitrary mistakes; they are firmly ingrained in the students' understanding of the concept.\cite{Hestenes:1985,Gautreau:1997} They are the tools for the students' everyday language and acts to define their way of talking and thinking.\cite{Mortimer:2003} 

These misconceptions originates in an erroneous or lacking \textit{conceptual understanding}. With grounds in the previous section, a conceptual understanding involves understanding of a subject's scientific story in its social language, i.e. grasping it's scientific concepts and relating them to fruitful spontaneous concepts and other scientific concepts which may act explanatory. Showing conceptual understanding involves therefore expressing it with words. Henriksen and Angell even propose that ``to think like a physicist is to talk like a physicist''.\cite{Henriksen:2010}

Angell also proposes that instead of labeling all faulty understanding as misconceptions, one should rather view them as \textit{alternative conceptions} or \textit{intuitive ideas} which might contain some degree of consistency and correct understanding.\cite{Angell:2004} Portions of the students understanding should be regarded as \textit{fragmented knowledge} which needs to be developed and refined into a more systematic scientific understanding.

Several ways of dealing with misconceptions, and consequently improving conceptual understanding, have been proposed, one being Peer Instruction.\cite{Mazur:1997} This method has been incorporated into the teaching of the students' mechanics course at the University of Oslo and involves conceptual questions with several answers being presented to the students during lectures. Importantly, only one answer is correct, while the others can contain more or less regular misconceptions. The main thought is that the students gain valuable insight by discussing the different answers with their neighboring students or with the lecturer. 


\subsection{Working with models in learning physics}

Traditional modeling of physical systems or phenomena involves using analytical mathematics for describing them precisely. Doing such modeling, however, requires not \textit{only} knowledge in analytical mathematics, but rather several \textit{representations} (e.g. experimental, graphical, pictorial, conceptual and mathematical) of the physical phenomenon.\cite{Angell:2008}

While working with computational modeling, the students still have to regard an analytical mathematical model of the physical system, but in addition they have to develop an algorithm for solving the assignments on their computer. For doing this, they have to make use of knowledge in numerical mathematics and programming for experimenting with their physical system, exploring ideas and assessing results on their computer. In this way, computational modeling of physics involves even more aspects than traditional modeling and, presumably, more representations for the students to deal with.

Regarding the new computational aspects, one may view good ``algorithmic thinking'' as abilities in analyzing a given problem, specifying the problem precisely and finding the basic actions needed to construct the algorithm for the problem at hand.\cite{Futschek:2006} Good ``computational scientific thinking'' may be regarded as the ability to use one's knowledge of theory, model, method and implementation to assess, visualize and explore a physical system with the means of experiments and simulations.\cite{Landau:2006} (more citations?) 

Sins and colleagues gives some thoughts on what teachers should keep in mind during novice students' computer based modeling (in this case with a drag-and-drop based program called PowerSim).\cite{Sins:2005} They point out that the modeling should include \textit{(sub)goals} for helping the students more easily grasp how the model structure affects the behavior of the phenomenon at hand. They also observe how the less skilled students often resort to a \textit{model fitting behavior} in which stress is laid on tuning model parameters in hope of getting an output resembling the observed empirical data instead of discussing more deeply the model's elements or structure.


\section{Method}

The method for gathering data in this study consists of qualitative observations of two pairs of students solving three compulsory assignments in mechanics. The data material presented in the next section consists of transcribed audio recordings from these observations. The transcribed audio has been translated from Norwegian to English with stress laid on conserving the \textit{meaning} in both individual utterances and the discourse as a whole. The persons referred to in the transcribed text have gotten fictional names to ensure anonymity.

My role as observer was a semi-active one, where I intervened with questions which could help the students express their thoughts and actions verbally. I also gave small amounts of help if the progression of the problem solving fully halted.


\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{Working in modes}
\label{sec:modes}

One of the first observations made, was the students' tendency to find themselves in ``working modes''. Depending on the exercise at hand, the students' work tended towards either conceptual knowledge of physics and everyday experience (``physics mode''), mathematical relations and arithmetic calculations (``math mode'') or sheer programming techniques or the programming language's syntax (``programming mode''). The physics mode and the math mode has been documented by others,\cite{Angell:2008} and were essentially the source of inspiration for trying to document these modes myself. The ``programming mode'', however, comes in addition as a result of the new computational perspectives introduced in the mechanics course. As well as the characterizations mentioned above, the programming mode have some other features as well. When writing program codes, the students' work has very little structure and they seem to enter some sort of ``trial and error''-mentality for handling even the most basic problems, be it either mathematical, physical or computer based (i.e. programming techniques or language syntax) in nature.

First, I'll illustrate the physics mode. The two boys are about to draw a free-body diagram of a sprinter running a 100-meter sprint:

\begin{dialogue}
\speak{The physics mode}
\small
\speak{G1} Should we not just -- isn't a free-body diagram just -- like this?
\speak{G2} Yes, but look -- at the start, he'll have a kind of log [starting blocks] to lean against and...
\speak{G1} Nobody has said that.
\end{dialogue}

G1 is correct. Nobody has said that; the model has no such condition (yet). Even so, G2's initial thoughts are set on the real race -- his first analysis of the race is based on spontaneous concepts originating from everyday experience (e.g. running himself, watching sprints on the television, etc.).

Second, a bit later in the same assignment, the boys are reluctant to seek aid from course material and want to solve the exercise ``\textit{Write a program to determine the motion of the runner from start to the finishing line}'' on their own:

\begin{dialogue}
\speak{The math mode}
\small
\speak{G2} No, but we have... We have an expression for the double derivative with the first derivative. And then we have the position as well -- we have $x$ -- hmm. We have, like, no... It's been a long time since I've done this.
\speak{G1} But...
\speak{G2} Like, we have a system of differential equations $x_1^{\prime} = x_2$. 
\speak{G1} M-hmm? 
\speak{G2} So we'll get out values for $x_1^{\prime}$ and $x_2^{\prime}$ -- or the velocity, that is.
\speak{G1} What's that?
\speak{G2} If we solve this, we'll get values for $a$ and values for $v$. And we can use Euler's, can't we?
\speak{G1} Yeah, we can just use Euler to solve those two and you'll integrate that, then -- what'll you get -- then you'll get your velocity?
\\ \dots
\speak{G1} No, I don't understand why this should be so difficult. Isn't this just a completely standard Euler? Where we can choose a standard Euler and we have a function $f(v,t)$? Which gives a...
\speak{G2} Yes, wait a minute!
\speak{G1} Then we'll get, like...
\speak{G2} A standard Euler? $x_{i+1} = ...$ or should we look at the speed as well?
\speak{G1} $v_{i+1} = a_i dt$ where $a_i$ is always [... reads the expression for the acceleration ...] and we've got $v_0$. There's nothing stopping us?
\end{dialogue}

The recalling of different fragments from the previous semester's course in numerical mathematics, gives some of this discussion a clear math mode-characteristic. Instead of talking about velocities and accelerations, G2 tends to call them ``$x_1^{\prime}$ and $x_2^{\prime}$'', and instead of saying ``$a(v,t)$'', G1 uses the more mathematical ``$f(v,t)$'', all the time focusing on the mathematical relations. Nevertheless, in the end they're able to bring their discussion over into a physics context -- the scientific, abstract mathematics are being related to something specific and definite. The fundamental mathematics, however, is being recalled from a distinct mathematical context; the students initially find themselves in math mode.

Finally, we'll have a look at the programming mode. As a first example, the two girls are working with modeling a 100-meter sprint. They have ended up with different values for the starting acceleration and have already spent some time going over J2's program code looking for typical syntax errors. They now discuss, rather shallow and while sitting in front of their respective computers, which value of the starting acceleration seems most plausible:

\begin{dialogue}
\speak{A starting acceleration of 5,5 m/s$^2$ or ...}
\small
\speak{J2} I think it's a bit hard to say if it's reasonable, that he can have 11 m/s$^2$ in the beginning as acceleration! Well, that's absurdly high!
\speak{J1} No, well, I don't think it's reasonable!
\speak{J2} No, but I'm just thinking about it declining so fast.
\speak{J1} Yeah, but well... Either it's something wrong with my program, or it's something wrong with your program, 'cause we should have the same. And I regard my acceleration as more plausible than yours! *Laughs*
\end{dialogue}

J1 opts for comparing the codes one more time. To solve this problem, the easiest solution seems to be looking for faulty lines of code. She also somewhat sets the mode to trial-and-error by means of comparison. 

Another example takes place in the girls' third assignment. They have been given a working program code, with the exceptions of some values which have to be filled in. In this code, the angular acceleration is not stored in an array, something both girls believes it has to be. If not stored in an array, it would be constant, they seem to think:

\begin{dialogue}
\speak{The need of an array}
\small
\speak{I} Do you need an array for alpha?
\speak{J2} Yes.
\speak{J1} Hmmm...
\speak{I} Why is that?
\speak{J1}  You probably don't need to store it all the time, but... It's not constant. I think. I don't know. We can try something clever, we can try writing it like this, then we can see if it behaves like it's constant.
\\ \dots
\speak{J2} But in the way he has written it, it looks like alpha is a constant.
\\ \dots
\speak{J1} Like he has written the program? Yeah.
\speak{I} Why is that? 
\speak{J2} He hasn't written any index?
\speak{J1} Because he hasn't given any alpha\_0 and no array for alpha or anything. But it could be something we should find out by ourselves.
\speak{I} But the way you have written alpha right there, if you don't store it as an array, would it still be constant for every loop?
\speak{J1} Since you're asking, it probably won't! But I think it should be!
\speak{I} Yes, I'm probably giving some hints right now.
\speak{J1} Oh no, yeah, so you'll just update it every time -- yes, that's clever!
\end{dialogue}


The girls should not need to ``try writing it like this'' and then ``see if it behaves like it's constant'' -- a clear trial-and-error solution. At the same time, their mind is set on the visual syntax of the program code, not on Euler's method and how it behaves. They focus on how the code has usually been written in similar contexts, not so much on the problem at hand.

Lastly, the boys are writing a program for the elastic pendulum:

\begin{dialogue}
\small
\speak{G1} Do you make unit vectors, or what?
\speak{G2} Hmm? 
\speak{G1} [Makes a decision without getting a response:] No, I'll just make these vectors and hope that Python is able to multiply them on its own.
\end{dialogue}

Here, G1 lets Python determine if what he thinks should work, actually works or not. He doesn't need to know on beforehand if it is going to work -- he rather trials and hopes for no errors. Furthermore:

\begin{dialogue}
\small
\speak{G1} I feel like this is kind of sketchy. From my part.
\speak{G2} Yeah, I too feel it being kind of sketchy, because -- that $r$ -- that's... 
\speak{G1} Yes, I have to make an $r_0$ and a $v_0$, thank you. 
\speak{I} What is it that's being sketchy at the moment?
\speak{G1} No, I just... I'm not entirely certain of what I'm doing. So I'll rather just gradually see if I'm doing something wrong.
\end{dialogue}

The programming lacks structure and relies to a great extent on a trial-and-error mentality along with recalling of similar tasks from earlier programming contexts. The students seem to be in need of some sort of plan and be made aware on what they \textit{should} do -- not just what they \textit{may try} to do.


\subsection{Starting to program without having a plan}

As mentioned in the previous section, the programming mode seems to lack ``a plan'' on how to create the program and how the programming should go forth. This may not seem so strange when they, in fact, never makes one. The students never opt for analyzing given problems or specifying them precisely. Instead of giving examples of this, I'll rather illustrate the one exception. Here, G2 makes an attempt to create a plan, but encounters heavy resistance: 

\begin{dialogue}
\small
\speak{G1} But, are we still supposed to do this analytically?
\speak{G2} Nope! 
\speak{G1} No, that's what I was about to say. I propose that we rather... [rolls towards the computers] Well, he haven't said anything about it, so we may do this however we want to?
\speak{G2} The $m$ was...? Eighty. Then we should solve the system? [continues with pen and paper]
\speak{G1} Yeah, but it doesn't say that we're supposed to do this analytically?
\speak{G2} ``Write a program to determine the motion''. 
\speak{G1} Yes, we can use the program to find the $v$ for us.
\speak{G2} We still have to find out which equations we should put into the program. He doesn't ask about the acceleration.
\speak{G1} No, but we'll integrate with the computer?
\speak{G2} Yes! But first we have to... We've got an expression for the acceleration dependent of the velocity. And then we're supposed to find the position, that is $x$, so we have to integrate $a$ two times, right? It's dependent of the derivative of... So it won't be an easy integral, in other words. I'm unable to explain it, but...
\speak{G1} No, I understand what you're saying, but...
\end{dialogue}

As the assignment is to be done on the computer, it seems natural to the students to take a seat in front of the computer sooner rather than later. Possible problems needs not to be discussed, but tackled when they arise.

\subsection{The length of the discrete steps}

Since possible problems clearly won't be discussed before they arise, the value of the step length or possible problems that it can cause are never discussed on beforehand either. The few times the step length is mentioned, a discussion never gets started. Instead, it generally is set to its ``usual value'' of 0,1. In the following example, the boys are getting rubbish plots of the elastic pendulum motion. In their strive for solving this problem, G1 illustrates his view on the step length, $dt$:

\begin{dialogue}
\small
\speak{G1} That $r$ of mine is alarmingly similar to itself. Okay. There's something wrong with... Ah, no wonder, ``$v + dt \cdot a$'', my $a$ must be erroneous.
\\ \dots
\speak{G2} Well, I think it's as early as my acceleration.
\speak{G1} Ha-ha, that's what I'm thinking as well. Ah, this is weird. When I print out $r_0$ times -- this is $r_0$ -- and then I multiply it with $dt$, I get zero! 
\\ \dots
\speak{G1} So $v_1$ is correct. And $r_1$ is given by $r_0$, which is correct, plus the velocity $v_1$, which is correct, times $dt$.
\end{dialogue}

Here, G1 has declared $dt$ as the total time divided by the number of steps, but since he has not made it explicitly a decimal number, it becomes an integer and therefore zero. The last sentence, however, is being uttered after this particular problem has been solved. The interesting thing is that G1 implies that everything is correct except the step length, $dt$. Even so, he is unable to call new attention to it. It's once again being viewed more or less as static. He is showing good insight into Euler's method, but is still unable to solve the problem. In this case, the step length has been declared with a too large value. The possible problems caused by a step length being too large is by no means unknown to the students. When the girls encounter a similar problem and eventually are able to solve it, J2 utters in frustration:

\begin{dialogue}
\small
\speak{J2} He could perhaps have given a small tip that we should make a fair amount of steps? So that people don't sit around and...
\speak{J1} No, no, no, they have taught us about this regarding Forward-Euler for a long time -- this we should know!
\end{dialogue}

J1 is correct. They should know about this, and they seem to do -- they just don't seem to be fully aware.



\subsection{Selecting the tools for solving the problem at hand: working with models ... or reality?}

Since the computational modeling includes a lot of different aspects to the physical system at hand, the students need to have some knowledge on all the different aspects, they need to have good modeling skills and they need to know when to use different tools and different sets of knowledge for the different tasks at hand. This is challenging and by no means obvious for the students. First, let's have a look at the girls' discussion when they're trying to grasp the meaning behind a plot like the one in figure \ref{fig:discrete_acceleration}:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[scale=0.67]{figures/acceleration_error}
 \caption{An erroneous beginning of the sprinters acceleration due to discretization and a faulty line of code.}
 \label{fig:discrete_acceleration}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{dialogue}
\speak{Discussion of a plot like figure \ref{fig:discrete_acceleration}}
\small
\speak{J1} Do you get a somewhat weird beginning on the acceleration as well?
\speak{J2} I don't know, I've messed things up a bit here right now, so... On the acceleration? I don't know!
\speak{I} What's a ``weird beginning''? 
\speak{J2} A smooth start, perhaps? 
\speak{J1} No, 'cause the acceleration starts at zero, but gets going very fast, so it becomes, like, straight up and such. And that's all natural compared to how he runs, but it just looked a bit weird. You would use a fraction of a second to get the acceleration from zero and up.
\speak{J2} Yes? 
\speak{J1} Yes, so it's all right.
\\ \dots
\speak{J2} I haven't gotten that, but... 
\speak{J1} That's why I'm asking, 'cause you haven't gotten that, but I have.
\speak{J2} But it's very logical, isn't it?
\speak{J1} I have no problem with it being like that. But I have in a sense no problem with it not being like that for you either, so I got a little -- ``what''?
\end{dialogue}

The problem is in this case caused by setting the initial condition for the acceleration to zero, when at the same time calculation $a_{i+1}$ instead of $a_{i}$ in front of the steps iterating the approximated solutions. The graph's ``jump'' is merely caused by going from the initial value of zero to a calculated value in one time step. When looking at figure \ref{fig:discrete_acceleration}, it should ring a bell in the students' heads clinging ``discretization!'' Instead, they do not seem to know whether or not the plot makes sense. For J1, it seems to make sense from an everyday point of view: The runner needs ``a fraction of a second to get the acceleration from zero and up''. When using her spontaneous concepts related to running she's able to make sense out of an erroneous graph.

Let's turn to the boys for our next example. Below, they are discussion a plot like the one in figure \ref{fig:jupiter}:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[scale=0.34]{figures/flower}
 \caption{The revolvement of Jupiter around the Sun at one fourth starting velocity ...?}
 \label{fig:jupiter}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{dialogue}
\speak{Discussion of a plot like figure \ref{fig:jupiter}}
\small
\speak{I} Do one fourth, like you did. [referring to G1's earlier attempt at one fourth starting velocity]
\speak{G2} Nooooo, ok. Aiaiai!
\speak{I} What happens here? 
\speak{G2} Nah, it's hard to say. It gets sucked -- it starts there anyhow -- then it gets sucked in, and then it gets more and more energy?
\speak{G1} Hmm? It can't get more and more energy?
\speak{G2} But it bounces out to here!
\speak{G1} Yeah, but at that point it's probably got zero velocity. 
\speak{G2} Ah, right, I thought about it completely wrong. I'm tired today.
\speak{G1} 'Cause it aaaalmost hits the Sun. Sweeps past the Sun. Or does it go through? No, it can't do that.
\speak{G2} The program would have stopped.
\speak{G1} Weeeell, would it?
\\ \dots
\speak{G2} No, I'm out of ideas. 
\speak{G1} No, but what happens, there aren't really any errors happening here, is it? It's just that it's being sent abruptly out again after sweeping past the Sun? The Sun bends its path tremendously.
\end{dialogue}

This discussion is somewhat similar to the girls discussion of figure \ref{fig:discrete_acceleration}. A lot of spontaneous concepts from everyday points of view are uttered in attempts to create meaning behind the plot, even though it's completely wrong. There is nothing in the model which would make the orbit change over time; it should stay an ellipse. Anyhow, as long as the Sun is able to bend Jupiter's path when it sweeps path the Sun at a close range, the plot makes sense for the boys. The problem in this case is the step length being chosen to be too large. This causes a substantial numerical error arises when the curve bends abruptly.

In the last example, the boys are trying to simulate the elastic pendulum while, here as well, having chosen a step length being too large. They get a plot like the one in figure \ref{fig:rope}, and G2's spontaneous comments to this plot follows:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[scale=0.68]{figures/rope}
 \caption{Plotted position of the elastic pendulum with the step length being too large.}
 \label{fig:rope}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{dialogue}
\speak{First thoughts on a plot like figure \ref{fig:rope}}
\small
\speak{G2} Yeah, I would say that this position seems kinda doubtful. The pendulum just -- ``pjiuoooo'' [flies away].
\\ \dots
\speak{G2} I don't get this. It just dances upwards. Just like the spring being totally crazy.
\end{dialogue}

A bit later, after having gotten some help by myself on solving the problem with the step length, the boys are trying to solve the exercise \textit{``Rerun the program with $k = 2000.0$. Describe the motion in this case. How can you use this method to model a pendulum in a stiff rope? What do you think would be the limitation of this approach?''} They quickly understand that a stiffer rope can be achieved by increasing the spring constant, $k$. Once again they get a plot like the one in figure \ref{fig:rope}. Even so, when trying to describe and explain what the odd behavior may be caused by, some noticeable comments emerge (from a rather long discussion):

\begin{dialogue}
\speak{Comments on a plot like figure \ref{fig:rope}}
\small
\speak{G2} It just implodes! It gets so large [...] I think in a way it gets so powerful it can't stay still without going bananas?
\\ \dots
\speak{G1} It's like -- if you pull --- like... Can it get so big that if you pull it just slightly, it flies absurdly far away?
\speak{G2} Yes? If a spring has the potential of exerting 40000 Newton if you pull it one micrometer, you can think what'll happen if it's L long.
\speak{G1} Yeah, exactly!
\\ \dots
\speak{G1} Like, see that you have a metal rod, and pulls it slightly, it will... Noooo, perhaps it does that as well.
\speak{G2} If you pull a metal rod, you will deform it. It won't pull itself back together again.
\\ \dots
\speak{G1} Yeah, but in this model... Does it exert a force if this is a rope and you pull it and let it go... A rope won't push the other way. A rope will just go up and... A rope just pulls, it doesn't push.
\speak{G2} But if the rope has a $k$ of 40000, it will push.
\speak{G1} What? No, what I mean is, a rope will only have a spring force if you pull, not if you push. If you push it in, it will only bend.
\end{dialogue}

They use a great deal of time discussing springs going bananas, metal rods and ropes, but they never starts discussing \textit{the model} and the \textit{limitations of computational modeling}. Although G1 utters ``but in this model'', he never seems able to go into the details of Euler's method's stepwise iteration or the problems caused by a step length being too large. When \textit{discussing} the model, ``reality'' -- or the slightly altered reality -- comes first. The problem with the boys' reasoning is that there's nobody in this model ``pulling'' the spring (other than gravity), and with regards to preservation of mechanical energy, the observed behavior is absurd.


\subsection{Meaning making -- dialogue, polyphony and the interplay of concepts}

The positive effects of a good interplay of concepts is already illustrated in section \ref{sec:modes} with the ``\textit{The math mode}''-discussion. In that specific case, the boys are recalling scientific concepts in numerical mathematics and, when mediating the concepts on a social plane, they help each other to recall other concepts and to establish these concepts in a physics context for the task at hand. This is typical for the boys' work with the exercises and acts constructive in their meaning making process: one mentions an abstract scientific concept and the other connects it to something specific and concrete.

The good effects of dialogic dialogues may perhaps easiest be illustrated with its complete opposite: the negative effects of the authoritative dialogue. As an example, we should look at section \ref{sec:modes} and the discussion ``\textit{A starting acceleration of 5,5 m/s$^2$ or ...}''. The full discussion is quite long, and starts out with myself asking the question ``who has the right answer?'', to which they answer:

\begin{dialogue}
\small
\speak{J2} I think you have the right answer.
\speak{J1} I think I have the right answer as well because it's closer to the original acceleration. 'Cause, an acceleration of 11 is completely insane, isn't it?
\end{dialogue}

\noindent From the beginning, J1 disregards J2's answer as being ``totally insane''. A bit later in this discussion, in the part recited in section \ref{sec:modes}, J1 still has a clear authoritative point of view, as she doesn't take J2's uttering of the graph ``falling so fast'' into account. This whole problem gets solved once I intervene and challenge J1 with a falling object-experiment. The comparison of the gravitational acceleration with their thoughts of what a sprinter could achieve, gives J2 the sufficient backing to oppose J1 and get them to actually calculate analytically the acceleration at $t=0$, not just comparing codes and talking about what's most ``natural''.

This last part functions as an example of the importance of polyphony and guidance as well. My voice, in this case in the role of a more capable peer, intervenes and socially mediates a meaningful reference which helps the discussion reach a conclusion. The same is the case with the discussion, also in section \ref{sec:modes}, on ``\textit{The need of an array?}'' Here, my critically charged questions are enough to get J1 to realize her mistake and come up with the correct answer; a more capable peer's indirect critique of one hypothesis is sufficient to make a new, correct one, emerge.


\section{Conclusion and implications}

\subsection{The fragmentation of knowledge: On working in modes and being bound to context}

One of the main challenges for the students is to make use of, jump between and combine different types of skills and knowledge for solving the problem at hand. The different tasks in the exercise opt for different set of skills which are learnt in different sets of context: ``comment on the results'' might be strongly bound to high school physics, while knowledge in programming and discrete mathematics -- which are necessary for discussing the model and modeling in detail -- might be bound to the first semester courses at the University. These new scientific concepts from numerical mathematics are not fully developed; they need more and better connections to concrete examples of usage in physics. One might say that the concepts do not yet ``feel like home'' in the students' physics environment.

\subsection{The lack of awareness: Modeling with brand new set of tools}

On the different tool sets and creating an awareness on how to use them, as well as creating an awareness on the differences between model and reality (and the limitations computer based modeling causes, e.g. discrete models). The new set of tools (programming and numerical mathematics) needs to get actualized in a physics context. Discussing the model \textit{requires} insight into the numerical mathematics and programming, but, as with the boys' ``reality'', the next best thing to do is to make an ``inner consistent understanding'', even though it might be erroneous. Angell's representations and Landau's computational scientific thinking demands a lot of awareness on the different tools and skills.

The students' are able to ``model'' without discussing or showing modeling insight. They should be discussing the model and the modeling with their respective restraints on nature, or ``reality'', when they instead discuss the \textit{real} physical system. When ``comment on the results'' enter the picture, the students leave programming mode in favor of physics mode and starts discussing the physical system in an inadequate fashion. [They need to be pointed to how and what to comment!] Talking about physical systems has its context bound to high school physics, where numerical mathematics and programming were out of the picture. 


\subsection{Developing modeling skills by imitating ``the skilled modeler''}

On Futschek's algorithmic thinking and how one should ``make a plan'' and on Vygotsky's view on imitation and how the students should somehow be able to imitate ``the skilled modeler'' (one who has good modeling skills -- he makes a plan and is aware!).


\subsection{On building up ``the scientific story'' of physics}

On narrating (or ... \textit{telling}) the scientific story. Dialogue and room for alternative hypotheses and multiple points of view. Theory fragments needs to be elaborated and connected to each other for developing ``deeper insight''. Understanding why one thing is erroneous, contributes to understanding why the other is correct.


\subsection{The exercise text as the narrator of the scientific story}

I propose that the exercise text can be both a good narrator of the scientific story and the grounds for imitating good modeling skills. It demands, however, a certain amount of awareness concerning aspects of learning when constructing the text. The text should be both instructing as well as elaborating. It can help the students grasp the scientific story, rather than testing if they are able to narrate it on their own given the right amount of story fragments. Important: Dialogic and polyphonic in nature, to a certain extent.
