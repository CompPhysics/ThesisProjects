  review = {"An excellent text … The postulates of quantum mechanics and the mathematical
	underpinnings are discussed in a clear, succinct manner." (American
	Scientist)
	
	
	"No matter how gently one introduces students to the concept of Dirac’s
	bras and kets, many are turned off. Shankar attacks the problem head-on
	in the first chapter, and in a very informal style suggests that
	there is nothing to be frightened of." (Physics Bulletin)
	
	
	Reviews of the Second Edition:
	
	
	"This massive text of 700 and odd pages has indeed an excellent get-up,
	is very verbal and expressive, and has extensively worked out calculational
	details---all just right for a first course. The style is conversational,
	more like a corridor talk or lecture notes, though arranged as a
	text. … It would be particularly useful to beginning students and
	those in allied areas like quantum chemistry." (Mathematical Reviews)
	
	
	
	
	R. Shankar has introduced major additions and updated key presentations
	in this second edition of Principles of Quantum Mechanics. New features
	of this innovative text include an entirely rewritten mathematical
	introduction, a discussion of Time-reversal invariance, and extensive
	coverage of a variety of path integrals and their applications. Additional
	highlights include:
	
	
	- Clear, accessible treatment of underlying mathematics
	
	
	- A review of Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian mechanics
	
	
	- Student understanding of quantum theory is enhanced by separate
	treatment of mathematical theorems and physical postulates
	
	
	- Unsurpassed coverage of path integrals and their relevance in contemporary
	physics
	
	
	The requisite text for advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level
	students, Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Second Edition is fully
	referenced and is supported by many exercises and solutions. The
	book’s self-contained chapters also make it suitable for independent
	study as well as for courses in applied disciplines.},

  abstract = {{<p>An esteemed researcher and acclaimed popular author takes up the
	challenge of providing a clear, relatively brief, and fully up-to-date
	introduction to one of the most vital but notoriously difficult subjects
	in theoretical physics. A quantum field theory text for the twenty-first
	century, this book makes the essential tool of modern theoretical
	physics available to any student who has completed a course on quantum
	mechanics and is eager to go on.</p><p>Quantum field theory was invented
	to deal simultaneously with special relativity and quantum mechanics,
	the two greatest discoveries of early twentieth-century physics,
	but it has become increasingly important to many areas of physics.
	These days, physicists turn to quantum field theory to describe a
	multitude of phenomena.</p><p>Stressing critical ideas and insights,
	Zee uses numerous examples to lead students to a true conceptual
	understanding of quantum field theory--what it means and what it
	can do. He covers an unusually diverse range of topics, including
	various contemporary developments, while guiding readers through
	thoughtfully designed problems. In contrast to previous texts, Zee
	incorporates gravity from the outset and discusses the innovative
	use of quantum field theory in modern condensed matter theory.</p><p>Without
	a solid understanding of quantum field theory, no student can claim
	to have mastered contemporary theoretical physics. Offering a remarkably
	accessible conceptual introduction, this text will be widely welcomed
	and used.</p>}},
