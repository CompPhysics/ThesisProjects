\section{$V_{low-k}$}

The nucleon-nucleon interaction has to be treated perturbatively when 
computing a twobody perturbation diagram. It is comfortable to do a cut off 
in the momentum. The cut off is based on two steps \cite{gamow}. 
Diagonalization of the momentum space for the relative momentum. The 
transformatin of $k \in [0, \infty)$ to $k \in [0, \Lambda ]$.
A typical value of $\Lambda$ is $\approx 2 fm^{-1}.$
