#  Determine what kind of effective interaction you want and the type
#  of calculation.  If you type 'open-diagrams', the code will produce
#  an effective interaction taylored to the Oslo shell-model code,
#  separated in three files, one for the pp case, one for pn and one for nn
#  For coupled-cluster calculations you will produce a file  containing
#  the effective interaction, one containing the kinetic energy and one
#  for the total single-particle energies.
#  You can also compute the binding energy of various closed core nuclei
#  The options are thus  1) open-diagrams for shell-model, 2) coupled-cluster
#  and 3) core-diagrams
#  Note well that if you choose coupled-cluster here, that will generate 
#  an effective interaction to first order (either with HF or with HO basis)
#  
type_of_interaction =  open-diagrams

#  You can also compute results to a given order in many-body perturbation
#  theory, in this case to third order. Options are 1) first, 2) second  and
#  3) third.   For coupled-cluster you have to stay with first order
order_of_interaction = third

#  Hartree-Fock option: Determine whether you want to do Hartree-Fock or not.
#  Options are 1) hf_iterations =0, no Hartree-Fock or 2) hf_iterations = 1 or any 
#  number larger than 0. For multishell effective interactions you may use 
#  a Hartree-Fock basis in order to avoid possible poles in a Harmonic oscillator
#  basis. Alternatively, use a shifted harmonic oscillator basis.

# MBPT option : Number of hbar_omega excitations in the various diagrams when you do MBPT, 
# typically two or larger

# A-dependent Hamiltonian : The no-core interaction is A-dependent by definition, but you
# can add a kinetic CoM correction to the G-matrix and the Vlowk Hamiltonians. To do this
# you choose between two options 1) no  or 2) yes
# When you generate effectives for  for the Shell-Model you normally endup using experimental
# single-particle energies and  then you should choose option 1).  For no-core you must always
# use option 2).
A-dependence  =  yes
