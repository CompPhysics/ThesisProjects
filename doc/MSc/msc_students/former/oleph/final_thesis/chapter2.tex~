\chapter{Renormalizing the Hamiltonian}

The calculations done in this thesis are based on the framework of the nuclear
shell model, with neutrons and protons as degrees of freedom. The effective
interactions are based on a renormalized nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction
including the Coulomb force.

The renormalization of the Hamiltonian is done in a harmonic oscillator basis.
This basis is also used for the Hartree-Fock calculations.

\section{Renormalizing the Hamiltonian}

We want to solve the non-relativistic Shcr\"{o}dinger equation for the nuclei
$^{14}$C, $^{16}$C, $^{15}$B and $^{15}$C,
\begin{align}
	\h\ket{\Psi(1\dots A)} = E\ket{\Psi(1\dots A)}.
	\label{Eq:SE}
\end{align}

Equation \ref{Eq:SE} is a many-particle equation that must be solved
approximately. Here we will approximate it by using two-particle interactions.
This is because the three-particle and higher interactions are more difficult
to calculate, and give smaller contributions to the total interaction. Also,
the program does not support three-particle and higher particle interactions.
Note that three-particle interactions can have a significant impact on the
binding energy, providing up to $10\%$ of the total energy, and sometimes
influencing the energy spectra.

The two-body Hamiltonian is given by
\begin{align}
	\h = \t + \v = \sum_{i=1}^A\hat t_i + \sum_{i<j}\v_{ij},
	\label{eq:Ham}
\end{align}
where $\hat t_i$ is the kinetic energy of nucleon $i$ and $\v_{ij}$ is
the nucleon nucleon (NN) interaction between particle $i$ and $j$. In nuclear
physics the NN interaction V is not well known, and there exists many methods
to derive it.

This Hamiltonian is often rewritten using an auxiliary potential $\u$,
\begin{align}
	\h = (\t+\u) + (\v-\u) = \h_0+\h_1,
\end{align}
where we want to choose $\u$ so that $\h_1$ is small. 

Our two-body Hamiltonian consists of A nucleons interacting with each other in
our infinite Hilbert space, and is too large for practical calculations. We
will use $^4$He as a closed core to reduce this space. This means that the 4
first nucleons of our nuclei cannot be excited to higher-lying states. $^4$He
fills the $0s$ shell, and is very stable. Excitations from the $0s$ shell is
therefore highly unlikely, and using it as a closed core will be a good
approximation. The closed core will be our new reference vacuum.

The nucleus $^4$He is
\begin{align}
	\ket{c} = \prod_{i=1}^4a_i^\dagger\ket0.
	\label{eq:core}
\end{align}

We will also map our Hamiltonian down on a reduced Hilbert space, our so-called
model space.

The wave function $\ket{\Psi_\lambda}$ in the full Hilbert space is
\begin{align}
	\ket{\Psi_\lambda} = \sum_{\lambda=1}^\infty b_\lambda\ket{\phi_\lambda}.
\end{align}

We divide the Hilbert space into a model space and an excluded state with the
projection operators $\p$ and $\q$, that map the full Hilbert space to
respectively the model space and the excluded space,
\begin{align}
	\p = \sum_{i=1}^d\ket{\phi_i}\bra{\phi_i},
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	\q = \sum_{i=d+1}^\infty\ket{\phi_i}\bra{\phi_i},
	\label{eq:Q}
\end{align}
$d$ is here the dimensionality of the model space.

The projection operators $\p$ and $\q$ are hermitian, and fulfill the
relations $\p\q=0$, $\p^2=\p$, $\q^2=\q$ and $\p+\q=1$.

In our calculations we will work with three different model spaces. These model spaces are listed
below.
\begin{itemize}

\item I now define the shorthand notation $0p\frac32-1s\frac12$. This notation
comprises the following single particle orbitals, $0p\frac32$, $0p\frac12$,
$0d\frac52$ and $1s\frac12$ for neutrons and protons. The notation
$0p\frac32-1s\frac12$ will hereafter be used for this model space.

\item I now define the shorthand notation $0p\frac32-0d\frac52$. This notation
comprises the following single particle orbitals, $0p\frac32$, $0p\frac12$,
$0d\frac52$, $1s\frac12$ and $0d\frac32$ for neutrons and protons. The notation
$0p\frac32-0d\frac52$ will hereafter be used for this model space.

\item I now define the shorthand notation $0p\frac32-0f\frac72$. This notation
comprises the following single particle orbitals, $0p\frac32$, $0p\frac12$,
$0d\frac52$ $1s\frac12$, $0d\frac32$ and $0f\frac72$ for neutrons and protons.
The notation $0p\frac32-0f\frac72$ will hereafter be used for this model space.

\end{itemize}

Using the $\p$ and $\q$ projection operators one can derive a new two-body
interaction that is effective only in the model space. This $\ve$ is also known
as the $\qq$-box,

\begin{align}
	\ve(\omega) = \qq(\omega) &= \p(\h_1 + \h_1\frac{\q}{\omega-\h_0-\q\h_1\q}\q\h_1)\p\\
	&= \p(\h_1 + \h_1\frac{\q}{\omega-\h_0}\h_1 + \h_1\frac{\q}{\omega-\h_0}\h_1\frac{\q}{\omega-\h_0}\h_1 + \dots)\p,
	\label{eq:Qbox}
\end{align}
where $\omega$ is a general energy variable, the so-called starting energy. See
\citep{kuo} for more details. This equation is also known as the
Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbative expansion.

For simplicity we will write $\h_1$ as $\v$ in our equations.

The $\qq$-box can thus be expanded in a diagrammatic expansion of the NN
interaction, as shown in figure \ref{fig:goldstone}. Note that in this case the
model space is defined by the hole states. Figure \ref{fig:goldstone} i) shows
a closed, first order Goldstone diagram, while diagram ii) shows a closed,
second order Goldstone diagram and diagram iii) shows a closed, third order
Goldstone diagram.

Diagram i) can be expressed as
\begin{align}
	(i)=\frac{(-)^{n_h+n_l}}{2^{n_{ep}}}\sum_{k_i,k_j\leq k_F}
	\bra{k_ik_j}\vv\ket{k_ik_j}_{AS},
\end{align}
where $n_h$ denotes the number of hole lines, $n_l$ the number of closed
fermion loops and $n_{ep}$ is the number of equivalent pairs. The subscript
$AS$ denotes the antisymmetrized and normalized matrix element
\begin{align}
	\bra{k_ik_j}\vv\ket{k_ik_j}_{AS}=\bra{k_ik_j}\v\ket{k_ik_j}-
	\bra{k_jk_i}\v\ket{k_ik_j}=\vv_{ijij}.
\end{align}
\begin{figure}
	\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}
	\begin{align}
	\put(-70,10){\epsfxsize=12cm \epsfbox{goldstone.eps}}
	\end{align}
	\caption{Closed Goldstone diagrams. Diagrams (i), (ii) and (iii) are,
	respectively, the first, second and third order contributions to
	the interaction $\v$.}
	\label{fig:goldstone}
\end{figure}
Diagram (i) then becomes
\begin{align}
	(i)=\frac{(-)^{2+2}}{2^1}\sum_{ij\leq k_F}\vv_{ijij}.
\end{align}
Diagrams (ii) and (iii) gives
\begin{align}
	(ii)=\frac{(-)^{2+2}}{2^2}\sum_{ij\leq k_F}\sum_{mn>k_F}
	\frac{\vv_{ijmn}\tilde{V}_{mnij}}
	{\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j-\varepsilon_m-\varepsilon_n},
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
	(iii)=\frac{(-)^{2+2}}{2^3}\sum_{ij\leq k_F}\sum_{mn>k_F}
	\sum_{pq>k_F}
	\frac{\vv_{ijmn}\vv_{mnpq}\vv_{pqij}}
	{(\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j-\varepsilon_m-\varepsilon_n)
	(\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j-\varepsilon_p-\varepsilon_q)}.
	\label{eq:goldDia3}
\end{align}

\begin{figure}
	\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}
	\begin{align}
	\put(-40,10){\epsfxsize=9cm \epsfbox{nn-potential.eps}}
	\end{align}
	\caption{Schematic model for the NN potential.}
	\label{fig:potential}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:potential} shows that the interaction $\v$ is large for small
values of the interparticle distance ${\bf r}$. We see readily from this and
equation (\ref{eq:goldDia3}) that the Goldstone linked-diagram theory is
unsuited for perturbation theory as the terms will only get larger when ${\bf
r}$ is small.

We need to use another method to solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Two such
methods that the program uses for finding the effective interaction are the
$G$-matrix and the Vlowk method.

\section{$G$-matrix method}

%Se side 130 for referanser for linjen under.
The $G$-matrix method was originally developed by Brueckner\citep{brueck}, and
was further developed by Goldstone\citep{gold} and Bethe, Brandow and
Petschek\citep{bbp}. It involves the summation of all the Goldstone
linked-diagrams. See for example \citep{g261}. It can be written as

\begin{align}
	\gg_{ijij} =& \frac{1}{2}\vv_{ijij} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{mn>k_F}
	\frac{\vv_{ijmn}}
	{\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j-\varepsilon_m-\varepsilon_n}\notag
	\\&\times \left(\frac{1}{2}\vv_{mnij}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{mn>k_F}
	\sum_{pq>k_F}\frac{\vv_{mnpq}}
	{\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j-\varepsilon_p-\varepsilon_q}\right)\notag
	\\&\times\left(\frac{1}{2}\vv_{pqij}+\dots\right).
\end{align}
This is a recursive equation, and can thus be written as
\begin{align}
	\vv_{ijij} = \frac{1}{2}\vv_{ijij} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{mn>k_F}
	\vv_{ijmn}\frac{1}
	{\varepsilon_i+\varepsilon_j-\varepsilon_m-\varepsilon_n}\gg_{mnij}.
	\label{eq:G_rec}
\end{align}
Although the interaction diverges for small values of $\bf r$ and although we
have an infinite sum, we know that the energy of the system is still finite.
This means that the sum in equation \ref{eq:G_rec} is convergent and can
therefore be calculated accurately.

The single particle (sp) energies $\varepsilon$ are given by the unperturbed
(non-interacting) Hamiltonian $\h_0$
\begin{align}
	\h_0\ket{\psi_m\psi_n}=(\varepsilon_m+\varepsilon_n)\ket{\psi_m\psi_n}.
\end{align}

We can now, using the projection operator $\q$ defined in equation \ref{eq:Q},
rewrite the $G$-matrix into a more general form
\begin{align}
	\g(\omega) = \v+\v\frac{\q}{\omega -\h_0}\g(\omega),
	\label{eq:G}
\end{align}
where $\omega$ is a general energy variable, that is, the unperturbed sp
energies for a general two-particle state.

Equation \ref{eq:G} assumes that $\h_0$ commutes with $\q$. If this is not the
case, then the $G$-matrix assumes the form

\begin{align}
	\g(\omega) = \v+\v\q\frac{1}{\omega -\q\h_0\q}\q\g(\omega ).
	\label{eq:G2}
\end{align}

We will in our coming calculations assume that $\h_0$ commutes with $\q$. This
is safe to do because we can always choose $\u$ so that $\h_0$ will commute
with $\q$.

Equation \ref{eq:G} is still problematic though, as we have the infinitely
large excluded space in it. To solve this we introduce a free scattering
interaction matrix ($\g_F$, which is easy to calculate), in order to get rid of
the excluded space dependency. In order to do this we need to define two
matrices $\g$ and $\g_F$, where $\g$ is the effective two-body interaction for
bound states, and $\g_F$ is the free $G$-matrix, that is, the free scattering
two-body interaction. I will, for simplicity, from now on write $\g(\omega)$ as
$\g$.

Before I define the $G_F$-matrix, I will show how we can express one $G$-matrix by another $G$-matrix.

We define two $G$-matrices,
\begin{align}
	\g_1 &= \v_1 + \v_1\frac{\q_1}{\e_1}\g_1,\\
	\g_2 &= \v_2 + \v_2\frac{\q_2}{\e_2}\g_2,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
	\e_i &= \omega_i - \q_i\h_0\q_i,& i &= 1,2. \notag
\end{align}
We define the wave operators
\begin{align}
	\o_i &= 1 + \frac{\q_i}{\e_i}\g_i,& i &= 1,2
\end{align}
This leads to the following relation
\begin{align}
	\g_i &= \v_i\o_i,& i &= 1,2.
	\label{eq:GO}
\end{align}
We can now write $\g_1$ as
\begin{align}
	\g_1 = &\g_1 - \g_2^{\dagger}\left(\o_1-1-\frac{\q_1}{\e_1}\g_1\right)
	+ \left(\o_2^{\dagger}-1-\g_2^{\dagger}\frac{\q_2}{\e_2}\right)\g_1,
\end{align}
and using equation \ref{eq:GO} we get
\begin{align}
	\g_1 = \g_2^{\dagger} + \g_2^{\dagger}
	\left(\frac{\q_1}{\e_1}-\frac{\q_2}{\e_2}\right)\g_1
	+ \o_2^{\dagger}(\v_1-\v_2)\o_1.
	\label{eq:G12}
\end{align}

When $\v_1 = \v_2$ equation \ref{eq:G12} reduces to
\begin{align}
	\g_1 = \g_2^{\dagger} + \g_2^{\dagger}
	\left(\frac{\q_1}{\e_1}-\frac{\q_2}{\e_2}\right)\g_1.
	\label{eq:G12V}
\end{align}

Now we can go back to the free $G$-matrix. The equations here are taken from
the article by \citet{G-matrix}. The $G_F$-matrix is basis-independent, and is defined as
\begin{align}
	\g_F = \v + \v\frac{1}{\tilde\omega-T}\g_F,
	\label{eq:GF}
\end{align}
where $\v$ is the usual two-body interaction, $T$ is the kinetic term and
$\omega$ is the unperturbed energy.

Since $\g$ and $\g_F$ have the same NN interaction, we can use equation
\ref{eq:G12V} to define $\g$,
\begin{align}
	\g = \g_F^{\dagger} + \g_F^{\dagger}
	\left(\frac{\q}{\e}-\frac{1}{\e_F}\right)\g,
	\label{eq:GGF}
\end{align}
where we have used the fact that $\q_F = 1$.

Using the matrix relation
\begin{align}
	\q\frac{1}{\q\e\q}\q = \frac1\e-\frac1\e\p\frac{1}{\p\frac1\e\p}\p\frac1\e,
\end{align}
we can rewrite equation \ref{eq:G2} as
\begin{align}
	\g = \g_F+\Delta\g,
	\label{eq:G-matrix}
\end{align}
where $\Delta\g$ is a correction term, defined fully in the model space $P$,
that gives us the bound energies. It is given as
\begin{align}
	\Delta\g = -\g_F\frac1\e\p\frac{1}{\p\left(\frac1\e+\frac1\e\g_f\frac1\e\right)\p}\p\frac1\e\g_F.
\end{align}
The $\Delta\g$ matrix is expressed in terms of the free interaction matrix
$G_F$, and is not dependent on the high-lying states in the excluded space $Q$.
The $G_F$ matrix can be calculated numerically exactly for the full
two-particle Hilbert space, and this makes the $\Delta\g$ matrix easy to
calculate.

Note that the $G_F$ matrix is still a recursive equation that needs to be
solved.
%The $G_F$ matrix is still a recursive equation that needs to be solved. We
%will in the next chapter show how this is solved with the
%Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger equation.

%In the $G$-matrix for finite nuclei method, the two $G$-matrices mentioned
%above are defined as following.
%\begin{align}
%	\g=\gg + \gg \left(\frac{q_l}{\omega-\h_0}\right)\g\\
%	\label{eq:Gfinite}
%	\gg=\v+\v\frac{\q_h}{\omega -\t}\gg
%\end{align}
%and
%\begin{align}
%	\q = \q_l + \q_h
%\end{align}
%where $\q_l$ stands for the lower-lying states in $\q$, and $\q_h$ stands for
%the higher-lying states in $\q$. Equation \ref{eq:Gfinite} is easily seen to be
%true by using equation \ref{eq:G12} and that $\v_1 = \v_2 = \v$ in equation
%\ref{eq:Gfinite}.
%
%I will not go into how to define $\q_l$ and $\q_h$ or the further calculations
%needed to calculate $\gg$. I will instead refer to the works of \citet{g261}. I
%will only say that $\q_l$ is commonly? chosen as the part of the $Q$-space
%where the interaction has negative potential.
%
%The $G$-matrix works in a single particle basis !Stemmer dette?!.
%
%!Dette avsnittet boer skrives om! Since $\g$ is a function of the unperturbed
%energy !Usikker paa dette!, we need to describe it by perturbation theory.
%Furthermore, the $G$-matrix only calculates the short range part of the
%interaction. Unlike the Goldstone linked-diagram theory, we can describe it by
%perturbation theory since the G-matrix contains all the diagrams in the
%Goldstone linked-diagram theory.
%
%One of the more common selected values for $\chi$ is $\chi$ = P*$\chi$*Q,
% as this choice gives eigenvalues that belong to the P-space.

\section{Vlowk method}

The Vlowk method renormalizes the Hamiltonian in the momentum space. First we
use a similarity transformation of the full Hilbert space to the momentum
space. This transformation is numerically exact. In the momentum space basis
we introduce a cutoff, were we exclude the states with high momenta. This
cutoff is necessary because we do not have a one to one correspondence when
going from the full momentum space. The low-momentum space will then be part
of our model space $P$, while the high momentum space will be part of our
excluded state $Q$. The NN interaction is strongly dependent upon this cutoff,
so care must be taken when choosing where to set the cutoff. Due to the choice
of cutoff, this introduces a stronger dependency on many-body forces than the
$G$-matrix. We need at least three-body forces computed with the same cutoff.

We have chosen a cutoff of $2.2$ fm$^{-1}$ in our calculations.

We start by using the Lee and Suzuki similarity transformation of the full two-particle Hamiltonian,
\begin{align}
	\H = \x^{-1}\h\x.
\end{align}

We divide the Hilbert space into the $P$ and $Q$ spaces. For the Vlowk method
these $P$ and $Q$ spaces are not the same as the models space given in figures
\ref{modellrom1}-\ref{modellrom4}. They are defined by the cutoff in momentum
space mentioned above.
\begin{equation}
	\H =
	\left(
	\begin{array}{cc}
		\p\H\p & \p\H\q \\
		\q\H\p & \q\H\q \\
	\end{array}
	\right)
	\label{eq:matr1}
\end{equation}

The Lee and Suzuki iterative method involves choosing $\x$ as
\begin{align}
	\x = e^{\w},
\end{align}
where $\w$, not to be confused with $\omega$ used in the previous section, is
defined to have the relation
\begin{align}
	\w = \q\w\p.
\end{align}
Using this definition of $\w$, $\x$ has the properties $\x = 1+\w$ and
$\x^{-1} = 1-\w$.

When we require $\H$ (\ref{eq:matr1}) to be block diagonal and set in for $\x$,
we get
\begin{align}
	\q\H\p = \q\h\p-\w\h\p+\q\h\w-\w\h\w = 0.
	\label{eq:QHP}
\end{align}
We then need to solve this non-linear equation for $\w$.

When $\w$ is found, the Hamiltonian projected down on the model space $\p\H\p$
becomes
\begin{align}
	\he = \p\h\p+\p\h\w = \p\h\p+\p\v\w.
	\label{eq:Heff}
\end{align}

We now do another similarity transformation $\u$ on $\he$ \citep{VlowkU}.
\begin{align}
	\u = (1+\w-\w^\dagger)(1+\w\w^\dagger+\w^\dagger\w)^{-\frac12}
	\label{eq:U}
\end{align}
We want the transformed Hamiltonian to be diagonal so that we can easily separate the interaction term from the kinetic term.
\begin{align}
	\vv = \u^{-1}(\h_0+\v)\u-\h_0
	\label{eq:V1}
\end{align}

Using equations \ref{eq:Heff}, \ref{eq:U} and \ref{eq:V1} the effective
interaction in the model space becomes
\begin{align}
	\ve = (\p+\w^\dagger\w)^{\frac12}(\p\h\p+\p\v\w)(\p+\w^\dagger\w)^{-\frac12}-\p\h_0\p.
\end{align}
To solve this equation we need to calculate the matrix
$(\p+\w^\dagger\w)^{\frac12}$, where $\w$ is found through equation
\ref{eq:QHP}.

I will now very shortly mention how to transform to the momentum space. For
further details, see \citep{G-matrix}.

We start by solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in relative momentum space
\begin{align}
	\int dk'k'^2\bra kT+V\ket{k'}\braket{k'}{\psi_\alpha} = E_\alpha\braket{k}{\psi_\alpha},
\end{align}
where we have used the completeness relation.

We discretize the Schr\"{o}dinger equation to get a matrix equation,
\begin{align}
	\sum_\gamma\varpi_\gamma k_\gamma^2\bra{k_\delta}T+V\ket{k_\gamma}\braket{k_\gamma}{\psi_\alpha} = E_\alpha\braket{k_\delta}{\psi_\alpha},
\end{align}
where $k_\gamma$ are the integration points and $\varpi_\gamma$ are the
corresponding quadrature weights.

To get a hermitian matrix we introduce $\ket{\bar k_\delta} =
k_\delta\sqrt{\varpi_\delta}\ket{k_\delta}$. After some calculation one gets
the effective interaction in the original basis $\ket{k_\delta}$,
\begin{align}
	\bra{k_\delta}\ve\ket{k_\gamma} = \frac{\bra{\bar k_\delta}\ve\ket{\bar k_\gamma}}{\sqrt{\omega_\delta\omega_\gamma}k_\delta k_\gamma}.
\end{align}

Thereafter, we transform this interaction to a harmonic oscillator basis in the
laboratory frame. This interaction is used in our calculations.

%Many of the formulas used for the $G$-matrix method also hold for the Vlowk
%method, and vice versa. But the calculations are done in different basis's

\section{Hartree-Fock}

The program has a Hartree-Fock (HF) option. If this option is chosen, then it
will renormalize the wavefunction with the Hartree-Fock method and use the new
HF wavefunction in the perturbation theory. !Usikker paa siste setningen her.!

The purpose of the Hartree-Fock method is to replace the interaction $V$ with
an auxiliary potential $U$ where we replace the interaction one particle feels
from all the other A-1 particles by one potential for the A-1 particles.

We can ease our calculations by introducing an auxiliary potential $U$ and
rewriting the Hamiltonian
\begin{align}
	H = T + U + V - U = H_0 + H_1,
\end{align}
where we want to choose a $U$ so that $H_1$ is small.

The Hartree-Fock method is about finding one such $U$. The $U$ chosen in the
Hartree-Fock method is the average interaction between one nucleon and all the
other nucleons. The energy eigenvalue equation can then be rewritten as a
one-particle equation,
\begin{align}
	[T(x) + U_1^{HF}(x)]\phi_i(x) + \int dx'U_2^{HF}(x,x')\phi_i(x') =
	\varepsilon_i^{HF}\phi_i(x),
	\label{eq:HF}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
U_1^{HF}(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n\int dx'\phi_j^*(x')V_{ij}(x,x')\phi_j(x'),\\
U_2^{HF}(x,x') = -\sum_{j=1}^n\phi_j^*(x')V_{ij}(x,x')\phi_j(x),
\end{align}
and $\varepsilon_i^{HF}$ is the Hartree-Fock energy eigenvalue for particle
$i$.

To calculate equation \ref{eq:HF} we need to know $\phi_i(x)$. In the
Hartree-Fock method we choose an initial trial wavefunction $\phi_i(x)$ and
initial position $x$ of the nucleons. We then find the energy eigenvalues and
eigenstates. The next step is to compare the old wavefunction $\phi_i(x)$ with
the new one. If they're not sufficiently equal, then we repeat the calculations
of equation $\ref{eq:HF}$ with the new $\phi_i(x)$. Then we compare that and so
on until $\phi_i(x)_{old} \approx \phi_i(x)_{new}$.

For a more detailed discussion of the Hartree-Fock method, see \citet{HF}.

After these calculations, we employ many-body perturbation theory to third
order. This involves Goldstone diagram, such as the ones shown in figures
\ref{fig:ld} and \ref{fig:td}

\fig{goldstoneLD.eps}{Two diagrams that are unlinked.}{fig:ld}
\fig{goldstoneTD.eps}{Two topologically equivalent diagrams.}{fig:td}

In the next chapter we will discuss the method we use to diagonalize the
Hamiltonian.

%From the $G$-matrix we get the unperturbed energy. The long-range part of the
%interaction can be calculated with perturbation theory. !Usikker paa om dette er
%riktig! We can find the unperturbed energy ground state by doing the following.
%\begin{align}
%	\Delta E_0 = E_0 - W_0 =
%	\frac{\bra{\phi_0}V\ket{\psi_0}}{\bra{\phi_0}{\ket{\psi_0}}}

%Before going any further we need to introduce the time evolution operator
%$U(t,t')$ that takes us from time $t'$ to $t$.
%\begin{align}
%	U(t,t')\ket{\psi(t')} = \ket{\psi(t)}\\
%	U(t,t') = e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}H(t-t')}
%\end{align}
%
%If we presume we have un adiabatic process, then we have the following useful
%expression.
%\begin{align}
%U(0,-\infty)\ket{\phi_0} \propto \ket{\psi_{\alpha}}
%\end{align}
%We can use this relation as a start to find a time-dependent perturbation
%expansion of $\Dela E$ This is done more conveniently in the interaction
%picture.

%It is shown in ?? that $\Delta E_0$ becomes
%\begin{align}
%	\Delta E_0 =
%	\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0}\lim_{t'\rightarrow-\infty(1-i\varepsilon)}
%	\bra{\phi_0(t)}V(t)U^I(t,t')\ket{\phi_0(t')}_L
%\end{align}
%where $U^I(t,t')$ is the time evolution operator in the interaction picture,
%and the subscript $L$ stands for linked diagrams only, which means that we only
%include the terms that, when contracted, gives us linked diagrams.
%
%The above equation can be rewritten as
%\begin{align}
%	\Delta E_0 =
%	\sum_{\mu=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\mu!}\left(\frac{-i}{\hbar}\right)^{\mu}
%	\int_{t'}^tdt_{\alpha1}\int_{t'}^tdt_{\alpha2}\dots\int_{t'}^tdt_{\alpha\mu}
%	[V(t)V(t_{\alpha1})\dots V(t_{\alpha\mu})]_L
%\end{align}
%
%The above equation can be expressed by a series of diagrams. The program uses
%Hugenholtz diagrams to express the above equation. The diagrams for the 1. 2.
%and 3. order of perturbation are shown in figures ?? respectively. The 1. order
%diagram includes all the possible one interaction terms. The 2. order diagram
%includes all the possible two interaction terms. And so on.
