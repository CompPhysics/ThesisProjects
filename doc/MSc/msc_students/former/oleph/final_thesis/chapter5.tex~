\chapter{Conclusion}

The goal of this thesis was to see if we could predict the $E2_1^+$ transition
strength of $^{16}$C that was measured by the now disproven? experiment
\citep{16CLifetime}. We did not predict this value, but we managed to predict
the new experimental value for $^{16}$C. Our results does not predict any new
physics involving the nuclei $^{14}$C, $^{15}$C, $^{15}$B and $^{16}$C, and
supports our current understanding of the nuclei and the forces that govern
them.
%Not all our results have been good, but these results can? be explained.

We could not predict the $E2_1^+$ transition strength of $^{14}$C. This
suggests that this transition is more complex than we have taken into account
for.\\
!Usikker paa hva mer jeg kan si her.!

An important part in the calculations has been to (not adjust / adjust as
little as possible)? the effective interaction. We have used single particle
(sp) energies that have been adjusted to $^{16}$O, but have not done any
further adjustments on these sp energies. Our results are limited, however by
the low number of states that have been calculated.

We have seen that we predict most of the low-lying states that we can predict,
though the energy values sometimes are too high. For all the nuclei we predict
the first excited state well. For $^{14}$C and $^{15}$C we need to work more on
the effective interaction. $^{15}$B and $^{16}$C, on the otherhand, come out
well.

We have seen that the $0p\frac32-0f\frac72$ model space has not predicted any
new states when compared to the $0p\frac32-0d\frac32$ model space, but it
brings the simulated? states much closer to the experimental states. In some
cases (see $^{16}$C, figure \ref{fig:16C}) we have almost exactly the
experimental states. It must be noted, though, that we have not seen a
convergence of states, and we need therefore to increase our model space so we
can see if we get a convergence. It should also be noted that we have only
calculated a few of the states for each nucleus, and it is therefore difficult
to draw a conclusion on how much of an improvement the $0p\frac32-0f\frac72$
model space is.

%Regarding the energy spectra, we have only/primarily? looked at low-lying
%states. The $0p\frac32-0d\frac32$ model space predicts most of these states,
%but the energys are generally considerably higher than the energys of the
%experimental states. $0p\frac32-0f\frac72$ model space brings the simulated?
%states much closer to the experimental states. In some cases (see $^{16}$C,
%figure \ref{fig:16C}) we have almost exactly the experimental states. However,
%we need to calculate higher-lying states in the $0p\frac32-0f\frac72$ model
%space to see if those states also comes out good. To do this, it is possible
%that we need to increase the number of particles we allow in the $0f\frac72$
%orbital.

Though there are several/some? states, mostly in $^{14}$C, that we have not
predicted and though the excitation energy sometimes is significantly higher
than the experimental value, there are several/some? important?
prospects/aspects? of the nuclei that we have predicted.

We have seen that $^{14}$C is mostly dominated by proton excitations, while
$^{15}$C, $^{15}$B and $^{16}$C are mostly dominated by neutron excitations. We
have also seen that for $^{15}$C the $0d\frac52$ orbital has higher energy than
the $1s\frac12$ orbital. All of these are in agreement with experimental
findings.

There are still several things that can be improved in our effective
interaction. I will list these here. The first three requires additional code
to be written for the program we have used, while the fourth means a bigger
Hamiltonian matrix to diagonalize.

\begin{itemize}

\item Resonances. They are important for $^{14}$C, as previously discussed, and
would most likely improve our results for this nucleus.

\item Center of Mass Corrections. This is another correction? that probably
would improve our results, however I do not know how much of an improvement it
would give.

\item Three-particle interactions. This is an important correction/(aspect of
the interaction)? that might bring the simulated? states dramatically/much?
closer to the experimental states.

\item Model space. Increasing our model-space is an obvious improvement.
However, this is restricted by computational power and would require better
algorithms or more powerful computers with more storage capasity. Still, it
would be a good improvement, as we could then see if we have a convergence in
our states. There are two ways to improve our model space. One is to increase
the number of particles we allow in the high-lying orbitals, such as the
$0f\frac72$ orbital, which would be an improvement for high-lying states. For the
low-lying states we have looked at, it is doubtful that it would bring any
significant change to our states. However, it should be researched a little
more to see if our restrictions on the $0p\frac32-0f\frac72$ model-space are
good, especially the exclusion of protons from the $0f\frac72$ orbital, which I have only looked at qualitatively. Another,
more important improvement, would be to increase our model-space by including
the $1p\frac32$ and $1p\frac12$ orbitals.

\end{itemize}

%Three-particle interactions, Center of Mass Corrections and resonances do not require more powerful computers, but they do require a rewriting? of the program we have used,
