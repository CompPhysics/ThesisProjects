\chapter*{Acknowlegdement}

I am very thankful to my supervisor, professor Morten Hjort-Jensen, who have taught me ever since 2009. He have been a mentor and helped me far beyond what I would expect from a supervisor. His enthusiasm and humor have been a motivation. I am very lucky to have met Morten. And I hope I have in return fullfiled his expectations. I am deeply grateful to the many hours Simen Kvaal have spent helping me to implement the transformations and writing replies to my questions. 

It have been both interesting and challenging to work with such a likable person such as Marte Hoel J\o rgensen, whom I worked with on the coding part. I admire her professionalism and discipline. And she have helped me to see things from other perspectives.

I would also thank Gustav Jansen and \O yvind Jensen for their insights and suggestions that have helped me understand the nature of my problems. Magnus Pedersen Lohne have been very helpful and responded everytime on email. Thanks to my fellow students David Sk\aa lid Amundsen, Andreas Nakkerud, J\o rgen Tr\o mborg, Christoffer Hirth, J\o rgen H\o gberget, who have helped me and made my time at the University of Oslo ver enjoyable.
 
I have enjoyed the physics aswell as non-physics discussions with my friends Henrik and Michael, they have broaden my perspectives on what is fruit or not. And it was certainly fruitful to say the least. It have been a challenging year, and skiing have been very relaxing, thanks to Patrick, Morten, Christoffer, Thomas, Henrik and Mikael for joining me for some memorable trips in Lillomarka.

Finally, I want to give credits to my mother, father, and my sister. Without their encouragement and support there would be no thesis.

\part{INTRODUCTION}

\chapter{Introduction}
The goal of this thesis is to show how we can study the double quantum dot potential using the CCSD method. During this process we have used Magnus Pedersen Lohnes Master's Thesis \cite{lohne} as an starting point, and a lot of work have been to optimalize his code. I have been working with Marte Hoel Joergensen \cite{marte} with the optimalization. And we have developed a method of using a Hartree-Fock calculation as an input to improve the CCSD calculations. 

This thesis can be regarded as a academic curiosity. However we will show the versatilty of the CCSD method and the generality of our potential, could be used in a real world scenario. This is the main reason why we want to study the quantum dot. People have applied DFT method to describe this system \cite{introdft}, but we want to describe it from a deeper foundation. That is why we use the ab initio CCSD method. And some of the physics behind the quantum dot have been used develop everything from devices such as single electron transistors and quantum dot lasers \cite{introqdotlaser} to ``artificial atoms'' \cite{ashoori}. They share the similar properties such as shell structure and magic numbers. Lately one of the important applications is the use of colloidal quantum dot for detecting canser cells \cite{gao}. For this we need a proper theoretical description of the electronic system, exchange coupling, correlation energies and ground state energies.

The quantum dot are esentially a device that can trap electrons, the typical size of these devices are between a micrometer to few nanometers. In these quantum dots we can quantum mechanical effects such as discrete energylevels. Our quantum mechanical model for the quantum dot is a parabolic quantum well which traps the electrons in two dimentions. Such a model does not exist in nature but is a starting point to understand realistic quantum dots. They are in fact crystalline and have periodic potentials. That is the reason why we are intereseted in the double dot. This could give us insights of the physics in more real life systems.

\chapter{Quantum Mechanics for single-particle systems}
\begin{quotation}
Quantum mechanics is that mysterious, confusing discipline, which really no one of us understands but which we know how to use. It works perfectly, as far as we can tell, in describing physical reality, but it is a ``counter-intuitive discipline'',as the social scientists would say. Quantum mechanics is not a theory, but rather a framework within which we believe any correct theory must fit. \it{Murray Gell-Mann, in Mulvey (1981)}
\end{quotation}


\section{Introduction}
I in the late 19th century scientists had problems with their classical understanding of the ways things are. Some experiments showed up that did not coicide with the current theories. And the beginning of quantum mechanics was when Max Planck published in (1900) a theory of black-body radiation. His explained that atoms can absorb and emit discrete quanta of radiation with energy $\epsilon = h f$, where $f$ is the radiation frequency and $h$ is the fundamental constant called Planck's constant.

\begin{equation}
h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} Js
\end{equation}
%
In classical physics we separate between the particle and waves, a classical particle cannot be wavelike and particle like at the same time. But as some the experiments have shown this does not reflect the reality (Young's famous double slit experiment). Quantum mechanics can sometimes be counterintuitive in that regard, but then again, Newton's theory of gravity must have been difficult to grasp at first. How do we know about these``invisible'' forces which we cannot see? 

Another problem poeple had was the atoms would be unstable if we had electrons that where particle-like and orbited around defined orbits. The orbiting electrons would radiate electromagnetic energy and eventually fall into the nucleus. We need to have a wavelike description of the atomic electrons in order to explain their stability. Wave-like electrons are confined inside the atom, and at the lowest state, the ground state, the electron cannot readiate away its energy and fall into the nucleus. This gave us a whole new way of looking at nuclear physics. It revolutionized the 20th century physics.

\subsection{Measurement and Observables}
Measurements are done by a subject, usually called an \emph{observer} who have an instrument which takes measurements on an \emph{object}. During this process we have disturbances and never ideal conditions, in classical physics the disturbance is directly associated with measurement itself and can be made arbitrarily small, depending of how good the engineers are. If we wanted to measure length with 5 decimal precision, we could just get a more precise ruler. But this is not the case in quantum mechanics. Each time we do measurements in quantum mechanics we have a probability distribution of different outcomes. This have nothing to do with the instrument itself, it is a part of the the instrisic nature of formulation of the quantum mechanics called the \emph{Heisenberg uncertainty principle}.

\begin{equation}
 \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
 \label{heisenberg}
\end{equation}
%
This means that if we determine the momentum exactly $\Delta x = 0$, then the momentum is totaly uncertain. The concept that particles exist with definite position and momentum is an idealistic classical concept.   

\subsection{The Schr\"{o}dinger equation} 
The Schr\"{o}dinger equation is the quantum mechanical eqvivalent to Newton's Second Law. It describes the motion of a quantum mechanical particle. This is a partial differential equation which describes how the wave function, representing the particle, \emph{flows}. The timedependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a particle moving in a three-dimentional potential is:

\begin{equation}
 i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H}\Psi
\label{schrodinger}
\end{equation}
%
Where $H$ is called the Hamilton operator and $\Psi$ is the wavefunction:
 
\begin{equation}
 \hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\vec{r})
\end{equation}
%
It is important to point out that this equation describes a non realtivistic motion of a quantum particle i.e. $E >> m_0 c^2$, where $m_0$ is the restmass of the quantum particle. 

\subsection{Probabilities}
Max Born introduced an interpretation of the Schr\"{o}dinger wave function $\Psi(\vec{r},t)$. He pointed out that the probability of detecting a particle at a particular location and time is proportional to $|\Psi(\vec{r},t)|^2$. Thus $|\Psi(\vec{r},t)|^2$ is often viewed as a probability density at the position $r$ and time $t$. And the wavefunction is often reffered to as a probability amplitude.

We can normalize our probability density to sum all the possible position of the particle to one:

\begin{equation}
 \int |\Psi(\vec{r},t)|^2 d^3 \vec{r} = 1
\label{normalization}
\end{equation}
%
The wavefunction could also be a function of momentum and thereby describe the probability for finding a momentum in a certain range.

\section{Postulates of Quantum Mechanics}
We could argue that Newton's law of motion is the postulates in classical mechanics. What are Newton's laws derivable from?. So likewise quantum mechanics is based on some fundamental ``laws of nature'' that must be underivable. 

A postulate is a statement made without any proof, an ``underived'' statement``. And in physics a postulate could be translated into a proposal which could either be verified or falsified based on experiment \cite{bowman}.

\begin{quotation}
{\bf Postulate 0 }{\it We describe a system by is its state vector $\ket{s}$, an observable q and is a hermitian operator $\hat{Q}$ which operates on any $\ket{s}$}
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
{\bf Postulate 1 }{\it The time evolution of the quantum state $\Psi$ is goverened by the timedependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation. $\Psi$ is a function of position coordinates $q_n$ and the time $t$. $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian}
\begin{equation}
 i\hbar\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \Psi
\label{eq:tdseq}
\end{equation}
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
{\bf Postulate 2 }{\it The possible results of measurement of an observable $Q$, are its eigenvalues $q_i$ of its operator $\hat{Q}$.}
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
{\bf Postulate 3 }{\it If the results of the measurements is found to be $q_i$, then after the measurement the system will ''collpase`` into a corresponding eigenstate $\ket{q_i}$.}
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
{\bf Postulate 4 }{\it The expectation value of an observable is given by}
\begin{equation}
\langle F \rangle = \int \psi^* \hh{F} \psi \, d \tau \qquad \mbox{(coordinate representation)}
\end{equation}
\end{quotation}


\section{Different Representations of Quantum Mechanics}
As we have seen, originally the state $\Psi$ was a solution to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, which was a partial differential equation, second order in space and first order in time. So the ''state function`` $\Psi$ have to be a function of time and space coordinates. We will be refer to this as the Schr\"{o}dinger representation. Quantum mechanics could be more abstract and more convenient shown by Dirac \cite{dirac}. Another way to represent it is by matrix mechanics introduced by Heisenberg.
Those are the main ways which we could represent quantum mechanics and they are mathematically equivalent.

\subsection{Dirac's notation}
An abstract quantum mechanical state $\Psi$ is represented by a ''bra`` vector $\bra{\Psi}$ or a ''ket`` vector $\ket{\Psi}$. The distinction between the forms lies in the context in which they are used and will become clearer when we show this. The scalar product in Diracs notation is the ''bracket``, which is very convenient compared to write the integral in the Schr\"{o}dinger representation.

\begin{equation}
\bra{\Phi}\ket{\Psi} \equiv \int \Phi^*(\vec{r})\Psi(\vec{r}) d\vec{r}
\label{eq:bracket}
\end{equation}
%
The expectation value of an operator is:

\begin{equation}
\bra{\Phi}\hat{Q}\ket{\Psi} \equiv \int \Phi^*(\vec{r})\hat{Q}\Psi(\vec{r})d\vec{r}
\label{eq:dirac_expect} 
\end{equation}
%
The time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the Dirac notation:

\begin{equation}
\hat{H} \ket{E_i} = E_i \ket{E_i}
\end{equation}
%
In this example we see that the label $E_i$ inside the ket, tells us about its eigenvalue. The spectra of the eigenvalues to an operator could be discrete or continous like the operator $\hat{x}$: 

\begin{equation}
 \hat{x}\ket{x} = x \ket{x}
\label{eq:xrep}
\end{equation}
%
If we wish to get back to the Schr\"{o}dinger representation $\Psi(x)$, we could do a ''projection`` of $\ket{\Psi}$ on the eigenfunction $\ket{x}$:

\begin{equation}
 \Psi(x) \equiv \braket{x}{\Psi}
\label{eq:coordinatrep}
\end{equation}
%
Similary the complex conjugate:
\begin{equation}
 \Psi^*(x) \equiv \braket{\Psi}{x}
\label{eq:ccoordinatrep}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Heisenberg's matrix formulation}
\label{Heisenberg}

The state vector $\ket{\Psi}$ is represented as a vector by its projection on a complete set of basis states $\ket{E_1},\ket{E_2}...$:

\begin{equation}
 \ket{\Psi} \equiv \left(\begin{array}{c} \braket{E_1}{\Psi} \\ \braket{E_2}{\Psi} \\ ... \\ ... \end{array}\right)
\label{eq:heisenbergstate}
\end{equation}
%
Similary we represent the operators by:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{H} \equiv 
\left(\begin{array}{cccc} 
\bra{E_1}\hat{H}\ket{E_1} & \bra{E_1}\hat{H}\ket{E_2} & \bra{E_1}\hat{H}\ket{E_3} & ... \\ 
\bra{E_2}\hat{H}\ket{E_1} & \bra{E_2}\hat{H}\ket{E_2} & ... & ... \\
... & ... & ... & ... \\
... & ... & ... & ... \\
\end{array}\right)
\label{eq:heisenbergopeator}
\end{equation}
%
Since the basis states $\ket{E_n}$ are the eigenstates of $\hat{H}$, its matrix representation is diagonal, and the diagonal elements are eigenvalues of $\hat{H}$. To diagonalize an operator in matrix representation is therefore the same as solving the time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation. 

This representation is very useful when dealing with angular momentum and spin.

\section{Angular Momentum and Spin}

In classical physics angular momentum is defined as:
\begin{equation}
 \vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p}
 \label{angular momentum}
\end{equation}
$\vec{r}$ is the displacement vector from the origin and $\vec{p}$ is the linear momentum. 
We can write out the components of the angular momentum operator in quantum mechanics by using the substitution
\[
 p_x \rightarrow -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}
\]
%
Gouldsmit and Uhlenbeck (in 1925) introduced the concept of interal, purely quantum mechanical, angular momentum called \emph{spin}. This was later experimentally confirmed by the Stern-Gerlach experiment (1922).

The spin eigenstates are:
\begin{equation}
\hat{S}_z \ket{l,m} = m \hbar \ket{l,m} 
 \label{zspin}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\hat{S}^2 \ket{l,m} = l(l+1) \hbar^2 \ket{l,m}
 \label{totalspin}
\end{equation}
%
And their commutation relation reads

\begin{equation}
  \left[\hh{S}_x,\hh{S}_y \right] = i\hbar\hh{S}_z  \qquad \left[ \hh{S}_y,\hh{S}_z \right] = i\hbar\hh{S}_x \qquad \left[ \hh{S}_z, \hh{S}_x \right] = i\hbar \hh{S}_y
\end{equation}
%
This basically means that we cannot determine eigenvalues of two different components, for example $\hh{S}_z$ and $\hh{S}_x$ simultaneously, they are \emph{incompatible} observables. But we can determine one of the directions and $\hh{S}^2$. The spin quantum numbers are \cite{griffiths}

\begin{align}
  s = 0,\frac{1}{2},1,\frac{3}{2},... \\
  m_s = -s,-s+1,...,s-1,s
\end{align}
%
Where $s$ is defined as the \emph{spin} of the particle. Electrons have $1/2$ spin while photons have $1$. 

\subsection{The wavefunction}
The total wavefunction of a state vector mentioned in Postulate 0 are composed of a spatial part $\phi(x,y,z)$ and a spin part $\ket{\chi}$. They are from different Hilbert spaces and mathematically the state vector are a tensor product of these two. 

\begin{equation}
 \ket{\psi} \equiv \psi(r) \equiv \phi(x,y,z) \otimes \ket{\chi}
\end{equation}


\section{Simple systems}

\subsection{Particle in a infinite potential well}
One of the simplest single-particle systems we could solve exact is the infinite one-dimentional potential well, defined by:

\begin{equation}
V(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
 -x &\mbox{ if $0\geq x \geq a$} \\
  \infty, &\mbox{ otherwise}
       \end{array} \right.
 \label{def:infinitepotential}
\end{equation}
%
and we want to solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with respect to this potential

\begin{equation}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} + V(x) = E \psi
 \label{eq:schrodingerinfinitewell}
\end{equation}
%
We can rewrite this equation

\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\left[V(x)-E\right]\psi
 \label{eq:rewriteschrodingerinfinitewell}
\end{equation}
%
For the case $x>a$ and $x<0$ where $E < V(x)$, then we see that the second derivate always have the same sign, and therefore cannot be normalized (ref postulate). Such wavefunctions cannot exist in this range. Therefore the wavefunctions only exist in the range $0\geq x \geq a$ and continuity of $\psi$ requires the boundary conditions $\psi(0)=0$ and $\psi(L)=0$. 

Using standard methods of solving second order differential equations (see \cite{boas} for details) we get 

\begin{equation}
\psi(x) = A\sin kx
 \label{eq:infinitewellsolution}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
k \equiv \frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar} 
 \label{def:k}
\end{equation}
%
Normalizing in order to get the constant $A$:

\begin{equation}
\int_0^a |A|^2 \sin^2 kx \, dx = |A|^2 \frac{a}{2} = 1 \Rightarrow |A|^2 = \frac{2}{a}
 \label{deriv:normalizing}
\end{equation}
%
We then choose to use the positive root 

\begin{equation}
\psi(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \sin kx
 \label{eq:infinitewellsolution2}
\end{equation}
%
Next we want to determine the konstant $k$. From boundary condition we know that $\sin ka = 0$. Then possible values for $k$ are

\begin{equation}
 k = \frac{n \pi}{a}, \qquad \mbox{with $n = 1,2,3...$}
 \label{eq:kvalues}
\end{equation}
%
and hence the possible values of $E$ from (\ref{def:k}) are discrete:

\begin{equation}
E_n = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2ma^2}
 \label{eq:energies}
\end{equation}


%%------Under construction--------

\subsection{Particle in a harmonic oscialltor potential well}
\label{onebodyharmonicoscillatorpotential}
The next simplest problem to solve is the \emph{harmonic oscillator} in one-dimentional case. The Hamiltonian we have are

\begin{equation}
  \hh{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}\omega^² \hat{x}^2
\end{equation}
%
Wher $\hat{x} = x$ is the position operator and the $\hat{p}$ is the momentum operator, given by

\begin{equation}
  \hat{p} = -i\hbar \frac{d}{dx}
\end{equation}

There are two main approaches to solve this, one of them is the analytical approach \cite{griffiths} and we get the solutions in Schr\"{o}dinger representation,

\begin{equation}
  \psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2^n n!}} \left(\frac{m\omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} e^{-\beta^2 /2} H_n(\beta), \qquad \beta = \sqrt{\frac{m\omega}{\hbar}}x
\end{equation}

And the eigenvalues,

\begin{equation}
  E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega, \qquad n = 0,1,2,3...
\end{equation}

The other way is algebraically \cite{griffiths} and we get solutions in Dirac formalism:

\begin{equation}
  \ket{\psi_n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}} (a_+)^n \ket{0}
\end{equation}
%
Where $\ket{0}$ is our ground state and $a_+ = (a_-)^\dagger$ is the creation operator
%
\begin{equation}
  a_{\pm} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\hbar m \omega}} (\mp i\hat{p} + m\omega \hat{x})
\end{equation}



%%-----------------  MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE QD -------------------
\chapter{The Quantum Mechanics behind Quantum Dots}
In this chapter we will give an quantum mechanical description for the 2-dimentional quantum dot. We will start by solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a single-electron parabolic quantum dot with an applied magnetic field. 

Recently development in techniques of quantum dot growth have made it possible to create better solar cells. But also other exotic phenomena as quantum computing. Quantum dot is a semiconductor on the nanoscale. It can trap one or group of electrons in a spacially confined potential. The size of quantum dot ranges from a few hundrer to many thousand of atoms \cite{qdotshur}. And it can confine everything from one electron to hundreds. 

\section{Description of the Quantum Dot}
As we have seen in the chapter 1, quantum dots are artificially created. And there are varius techniques and methods for creating quantum dots, which gives us them different properties. In this thesis we will concentrate on the quantum dots created inside the Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) semiconductors. The semiconductor is sandwiched between layers of Aluminum Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs) semiconductor material which has a bigger bandgap. This acts like an insulator and results in a confinement in the vertical direction. Our choice for the confinement potential is a parabolic harmonic oscillator $\omega_x = \omega_y = \omega$. Both numerical \cite{numerical1, numerical2} and experimental \cite{experimental1, experimental2} studies have shown that this is a reasonable approximation. And in our case the electrons inside will only feel the Coulomb interaction. The Hamiltonian then becomes 
\begin{equation}
\hh{H} = \sum_{i=1}^N \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m^*} \nabla_i^2 + \frac{1}{2} m^* \omega^2 r_i^2 \right) + \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r} \sum_{i<j}^N \frac{1}{r_{ij}}
  \label{Hamiltonian for QD}
\end{equation}
The $e$ is the electron charge, $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity, and $r_{ij} = |r_i - r_j|$, $\omega$ is the oscillator frequency, and $r_i$ is the distance from electron $i$ to the potential minimun $(r=0)$.
It is important to notice that the $m^*$ here is the effective electron mass and not be mistaken by the Newtonian reduced mass which is a classical phenomena. This is an simplification we have made to our problem. The effective electron mass differs from the free-electron mass $m$ and its isotropic and independent of both the position and the energy of the electron. The effective mass is the result of motion of an electron in a periodic potential \cite{quantumheterostructures}. For example in GaAs the electrons appear to carry mass that is only $7\%$ of the free-electron mass \cite{ashoori}.  

\section{The One-electron Quantum Dot}
We start by derving the wavefunctions for a general spherical symmetric potential $V(r) = V(-r)$ in two dimentions. Our Hamiltonian in cartesian coordinates reads
\begin{equation}
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*} \nabla^2 \psi(x,y) + V(x,y) \psi(x,y) = E \psi(x,y)
   \label{Hamiltonian cartesian coordinates}
\end{equation}
%
We want to do rewrite this using polar coordinates
%
\begin{align}
x &= r \cos \theta \\
y &= r \sin \theta \\
r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\end{align}
The Laplacian them becomes
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 = \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^2} 
  \label{laplacian in 2D}
\end{equation}
Inserting this into Eq. (\ref{Hamiltonian cartesian coordinates}) gives us the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in polar coordintes
\begin{equation}
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*} \left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}\right) \psi(r,\theta) + V(r) \psi(r,\theta) = E \psi(r,\theta)
   \label{Hamiltonian polar coordinates}
\end{equation}
Introduction a solution on the form $\psi(r,\theta) = R(r) Y(\theta)$ and multiplying by $\frac{2m^*}{\hbar^2 R(r)Y(\theta)}r^2$ in Eq. (\ref{Hamiltonian polar coordinates}) we obtain

\begin{equation}
\frac{r^2}{R(r)}\left[\frac{d^2 R}{d r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{dR}{dr} + \frac{2m^*}{\hbar^2}(E-V(r))R(r) \right] = -\frac{1}{Y(\theta)}\frac{\partial^2 Y(\theta)}{\partial \theta^2}
  \label{separable Hamiltonian 2}
\end{equation}
The left side of this equation depends on $r$ while the right side depends on $\theta$. This can only be satisfyied if each term is equal to a constant $k=m^2$
%
\begin{align}
\frac{r^2}{R(r)}\left[\frac{d^2 R}{d r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{dR}{dr} + \frac{2m^*}{\hbar^2}(E-V(r))R(r) \right] &= -m^2 \label{separation constants1} \\
\frac{1}{Y(\theta)}\frac{\partial^2 Y(\theta)}{\partial \theta^2} &= m^2 
  \label{separation constants2}
\end{align}
%
The solution to anuglar part Eq. (\ref{separation constants2}) is 
\begin{equation}
Y(\theta)  = Ce^{im\theta}  
\end{equation}
%
Normalization gives us the constant $C$
\begin{equation}
C^2 = \frac{1}{\int_0^{2\pi}Y(\theta)^2 \, d\theta} = \frac{1}{2\pi}
  \label{constant C}
\end{equation}
%
The normalized solution for the angular part is
\begin{equation}
Y(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{im\theta}
  \label{normalized angular part}
\end{equation}
%
The total wavefunction must satisfy the physical condition that $\psi(r,\theta) = \psi(r,\theta+2\pi)$ This makes a restriction on the quantum number $m$ which can take integral values
\begin{equation}
m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, ...
  \label{m quantum number}
\end{equation}
For the Eq. (\ref{separation constants1}) we can simplify by defining
\begin{equation}
  u(r) = \sqrt{r}R(r) \Rightarrow R(r) = \frac{u(r)}{\sqrt{r}}
  \label{radialequation function}
\end{equation}
which yields
\begin{equation}
  -\frac{\hbar}{2m^*}\frac{d^2 u}{dr^2} + \left[ V(r) + \frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*} \frac{m^2-\frac{1}{4}}{r^2} \right] u(r) = E u(r)
\end{equation}
This is the radial equation. And it have the same form as the one-dimentional time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation with an effective potential
\begin{equation}
V_{eff} = V(r) + \frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*}\frac{m^2-\frac{1}{4}}{r^2}
  \label{effective potential}
\end{equation}
The radial function Eq. (\ref{radialequation function}) must satisfy the normalization conditions
\begin{equation}
\int_0^\infty |u(r)|^2 dr = 1
  \label{normalization radial}
\end{equation}
For this to be normalizable we must require the boundary conditions 
\begin{equation}
  \text{$u(0) = C$ and $u(\infty) = 0$}, \quad \text{where $C$ is a constant}
\end{equation}
%
Finally the general solutions to the spherical symmetrical potential is
\begin{equation}
\psi(r,\theta) = R(r) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{im\theta} 
  \label{final solution to spherical}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Parabolic quantum dot with influence of an electromagnetic field}
\label{parabolic quantum dot}

As an academic exercise we shall solve the one-electron Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a quantum dot in 2 dimentions. Most of the derivation here are taken from \cite{jackson}. The classical Hamiltonian of a charged electron in a electromagnetic field reads
  
  \begin{equation}
   H = \frac{1}{2m}(\bb{p} - e\bb{A})^2 + e\phi 
   \label{electromagnetic Hamiltonian}
 \end{equation}
%
with $\bf{A}$ and $\phi$ as the electromagnetic vector and scalar potentials, $m$ is the electron mass, $e$ is the charge, and $\bb{p}$ is the momentum vector. The electromagnetic fields are related to the potentials  
\begin{align}
\bb{E} &= - \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \bb{A}}{\partial t} - \nabla \phi \\ 
\bb{B} &= \nabla \times \bb{A}
  \label{elmag potentials}
\end{align}
where $\bb{E}$ is electric field, and $\bb{B}$ is the magnetic field, which satisfies Maxwells equations. The quantum mechanical Hamiltonian consist of and additional term which couples the spin to the electromagnetic field $-\mu\cdot \bb{B}$, where $\mu$ is the magnetic moment of the electron. 
\begin{equation}
  \hh{H} = \frac{1}{2m^*} (\hh{p} - e\bb{A})^2 + e\phi +\frac{1}{2}m^* \omega_0^2 r^2 - \hh{\mu} \bb{B}
  \label{Total Hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
Here the $\hh{p}$ is a quantum mechanical momentum operator. The time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger we want to solve is 
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2m^*} (\hh{p} - e\bb{A})^2 + e\phi +\frac{1}{2}m^* \omega_0^2 r^2 - \hh{\mu} \cdot \bb{B} \psi(\bb{r}) & = E \psi(\bb{r})
  \label{Time-independent SE}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
H_r &= \frac{1}{2m^*} (\hh{p} - e\bb{A})^2  +\frac{1}{2}m^* \omega_0^2 r^2\label{spatial hamiltonian}\\
H_s &=  - \hh{\mu} \cdot \bb{B} \label{spin hamiltonian}
\end{align}
%
where the wavefunction $\psi(\bb{r})$ also include the spin part which are decoupled with the spatial part, i.e. their expectation are uncorrolated, and we can therefore write the wavefunction as a product of each.
\begin{equation}
 \psi(\bb{r}) = R(r) \otimes \ket{m_s}  
  \label{wavef spin}
\end{equation}
%
Here the quantum number $m_s=\pm \frac{1}{2}$, since electrons are fermions. Inserting this into Eqs.(\ref{spatial hamiltonian}) and (\ref{spin hamiltonian}) we obtain two equations, one spatial and one spin dependent
\begin{align}
  \left(\frac{1}{2m^*} (\hh{p} - e\bb{A})^2 + e\phi +\frac{1}{2}m^* \omega_0^2 r^2 \right)R(r) &= E_r R(r) \\
  -(\mu \cdot \bb{B}) \ket{m_s} &= E_s \ket{m_s}
\end{align}
%
Which gives us the total energy 
%
\begin{equation}
E = E_r + E_s + e\phi
  \label{total energy}
\end{equation}
%
We want to do a gauge transformation on the potential $\bb{A}$ with the Coulomb gauge condition. This will not change the potentials $\bb{E}$ and $\bb{B}$.
%
\begin{equation}
\bb{\nabla} \cdot \bb{A} = 0
  \label{gauge}
\end{equation}
%
A choice that satisfy this condition is 
\begin{equation}
\vec{A} = \frac{1}{2} \bb{B} \times \left(x\,\bb{i} + y \, \bb{j} \right)
  \label{coulomb gauge}
\end{equation}
%
We want to expand the first term in the spatial Hamiltonian $\hh{H}_r$ Eq. (\ref{spatial hamiltonian}) using the condition Eq. (\ref{coulomb gauge})

\begin{align}
(\hh{p}^2 - e\bb{A})^2 &= \hh{p}^2 - e(\hh{p}\bb{A} + \bb{A}\hh{p}) + e^2 \bb{A}  \\
& = \hh{p}^2 - 2e \bb{A}\cdot\hh{p}+ e^2 \bb{A}^2 \label{second deriv} \\
& = \hh{p}^2 - e\mathbf{B}\cdot \hh{L} + \frac{e^2}{4}\left(\mathbf{B} \times (x \bb{i} + y \bb{j}) \right)^2 \label{thirdeq}  
\end{align}
%
In Eq. (\ref{second deriv}) we have used that $\hh{p}$ and $\bb{A}$ commute because of the coulomb gauge. 
\begin{equation}
\hh{p} \cdot \mathbf{A} \psi = -i\hbar\nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf{A} \psi \right) = -i\hbar\left( \underbrace{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}}_{=0} + \mathbf{A} \cdot \nabla \psi \right) = \mathbf{A} \cdot \left(-i\hbar\nabla \psi \right) = \bb{A}\cdot \hh{p} \psi
\end{equation}
And in Eq. (\ref{thirdeq}) we have used the relation 
\begin{equation}
 \left( \mathbf{B} \times \vec{r} \right) \cdot \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{B} \cdot \left( \vec{r}  \times \mathbf{p} \right) =  \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{L}
  \label{math relation cross}
\end{equation}
%
The applied magnetic field is constant and homogeneous along the z-axis. $\bb{B} = B_0 \bb{k}$. Then our spatial Hamiltonian $\hh{H}_r$ simplifies to 
\begin{equation}
\hh{H}_r = \frac{1}{2m^*} \left[\hh{p}^2 - e\mathbf{B_0}\left(x\hh{p}_y - y \hh{p}_x \right) + \frac{e^2B_0^2}{4}\left( x^2 + y^2 \right)\right]
 + \frac{1}{2} m^* \omega_0^2 (x^2+y^2)
  \label{total hamiltonian 2}
\end{equation}
%
Introducing
\begin{equation}
  \omega_B \equiv \frac{eB_0}{2m^*}
\end{equation}
%
And 
\begin{equation}
  \omega \equiv \omega_0 + \omega_B^2
\end{equation}
%
The Hamiltonian becomes 
\begin{equation}
\hh{H}_r = \frac{1}{2m^*} \left(\hh{p}^2 - eB_0\hh{L}_z \right) + \frac{1}{2} m^* \omega^2 \left(x^2+y^2\right) \label{final Hamil}
\end{equation}
%
Where $\hh{L}_z$ is the angular momentum in the $z$-direction. $L_z = x\hh{p}_y - y \hh{p}_x$ \cite{hemmer}. The next step is tranform the Hamiltonian Eq. (\ref{final Hamil}) from a cartesian coordinate representation to a polar coordinate representation. Then the angular momentum can be expressed
as \cite{hemmer} 
\begin{equation}
\hh{L}_z = -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}
  \label{Lz in polar}
\end{equation}
%
Which yields the time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation for $\hh{H}_r$ Eq. (\ref{spatial hamiltonian})
\begin{equation}
\left[ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*} \left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2} - \frac{ieB_0}{\hbar} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right) + \frac{1}{2}m^*\omega^2 r^2 \right] \psi(r,\theta) = E \psi(r,\theta)
  \label{Hamilton in polar}
\end{equation}
This is almost the same as Eq. (\ref{Hamiltonian polar coordinates}) which we have solved, except now have an additional term $\frac{ieB_0}{\hbar} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}$  caused by the magnetic field. But this can be seprated from the radial equation, since it only depends on the angle $\theta$. 
%
The wavefunction can still be seprated in an angular and a radial part, and we will use the same ansatz as Eq. (\ref{final solution to spherical})
\begin{equation}
\psi(r,\theta) = R(r) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{im\theta}, \qquad m=0,\pm 1, \pm 2,... 
  \label{wave function ansatz}
\end{equation}
%
Inserting this to Eq. (\ref{Hamiltonian polar coordinates}) 
\begin{align}
\left[ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*} \left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} + \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2} + \frac{meB_0}{\hbar} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right) + \frac{1}{2}m^*\omega^2 r^2 \right] R(r) = E_r R(r)
  \label{Hamilton in polar 2}
\end{align}
%
The solution of this radial equation is
%
\begin{equation}
R_{nm}(r) = \sqrt{\frac{2n!}{(n+|m|)!}}\beta^{\frac{1}{2}(|m|+1)}r^{|m|}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\beta r^2} L_n^{|m|} (\beta r^2)
  \label{Laguerre solutions}
\end{equation}
%
Here the subscript $n$ denote the principal quantum number, and $m$ is the angular momentum number
\begin{align}
  n &= 0, 1, 2, 3, .... \\
  m &= 0, \pm 1, \pm, 2, \pm 3,...
\end{align}

$L_n^{|m|}$ is the associated Laguerre polynomials \cite{arfken}, and $\beta$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\beta = \frac{m^*\omega}{\hbar}
  \label{definition beta}
\end{equation}
%
The final eigenfunction to the spatial Hamiltonian $H_r$ is then
%
\begin{equation}
 \psi(r,\theta) = \sqrt{\frac{n!}{\pi(n+|m|)!}}\beta^{\frac{1}{2}(|m|+1)}r^{|m|}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\beta r^2} L_n^{|m|} (\beta r^2) e^{im\theta}
 \label{final for spatial Hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
%
With the corresponding eigenvalues
%
\begin{equation}
E_r = (1+|m|+2n)\hbar \omega + m\hbar \omega_B
  \label{corresponding eigenvalues}
\end{equation}
%
See Appendix in \cite{lohne} and \cite{drosdal} for details. Now we consider the spin Hamiltonian $H_s$ Eq. (\ref{spin hamiltonian}). The quantum mechanical magnetic moment $\hh{mu}$ is given by \cite{griffiths}

\begin{equation}
\hh{\mu} = \frac{eg}{2m^*} \hh{S}
  \label{magnetic moment}
\end{equation}
%
where $g$ is the $g$-factor and approximate $2$ for the electron. $\hh{S}$ is the spin operator. Since the magnetic field is $\mathbf{B} = B_0 \bb{k}$, the Schr\"{o}dinger equation reads
%
\begin{equation}
-\frac{egB_0}{2m^*}S_z\ket{m_s} = E_s \ket{m_s}
  \label{SL for the spin part}
\end{equation}
%
$\hh{S}_z$ is the $z$-component of the total spin $\hh{S}$. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of this operator are given by [Insert ref]
%
\begin{equation}
E_s = -\frac{eg\hbar B_0}{2m^*}m_s = gm_s \hbar \omega_B
  \label{eigenvalue for spin}
\end{equation}
%
The total eigenvalue for the system becomes
\begin{equation}
E = (1+|m|+2n)\hbar \omega + m \hbar \omega_B + g m_s \hbar \omega_B + e\phi
  \label{total energyeigenvalue}
\end{equation}
And the corresponding eigenstate
\begin{equation}
\psi_{nmm_s}(\bb{r},\theta) = \sqrt{\frac{n!}{\pi(n+|m|)!}}\beta^{\frac{1}{2}(|m|+1)}r^{|m|}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\beta r^2} L_n^{|m|} (\beta r^2) e^{im\phi} \otimes \ket{m_s}
  \label{total eigenstate}
\end{equation}
%
Without any external magnetic field $\bb{B} = 0$, the energy becomes spin-indenpendent because $\omega_B = 0$
\begin{equation}
E_{nm}^0 = (1+|m|+2n) \hbar \omega_0 
  \label{spin independent energy}
\end{equation}
%
In the spirit of perturbation theory we denote this with a superscript $0$. We will have a degeneracy in spin since the Hamiltonian is spin-independent. For each pair of the quantum numbers $\{n,m\}$ we have two different quantum states, one with $m_s=-\frac{1}{2}$ and the other with $m_s=\frac{1}{2}$.
\begin{equation}
R \equiv (1+|m|+2n)
  \label{shellnumber}
\end{equation}
%
$R$ is defined as the \emph{shellnumber}, it correspond to the energy level and the degeneracy for each level $R$ is
\begin{equation}
  g(R) = 2R
\end{equation}
%
This system have a \emph{shell structure}, Figure \ref{fig:shellnumber}, i.e. the energy levels are equidistant from each other and we have a defined degeneracy. This is similar to the shell model in nuclear physics, in which Goeppert-Mayer, Wiger and Jensen was awarded the nobelprize (1963).
%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\scalebox{0.6}{\input{shell.pdftex_t}}
\caption{Shell structure of a single-electron parabolic quantum dot for $\bb{B=0}$, where $R$ is the shell number defined in Eq. (\ref{shellnumber}) and $m$ is the angular quantum number. The arrows $\uparrow \downarrow$ denote the spin quantum number $m_s=\pm \frac{1}{2}$}
\label{fig:shellnumber}
\end{figure}
%
The total number of spin-orbitals for a given shellnumber $R$ is 
%
\begin{equation}
  N = \sum_{R=0}^{R'} g(R) = 2R' + 2(R'-1) + 2(R'-3) + ... + 2
\end{equation}
%
We have tabulated some of the values in Table \ref{tab:shellfilling} 

\begin{table}[H]
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{rrr}
\toprule
$R$ & $g(R)$ & $N$\\
\midrule
1	& 2 	 &  2 \\

4	& 8 	 &  20  \\
8	& 16 	 &  72 \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Some values for different shellnumber $R$, where $g(R)$ is the degeneracy. $N$ is the total number of single-electron spin-orbitals occupied in $R$-number of shelles. This is often refered to \emph{magic numbers} which indicate the number of spin-orbitals need to complete the shells.}
\label{tab:shellfilling}
\end{table}
%
If we take a look at Eq. (\ref{total energyeigenvalue}), we see that in a presense of a magnetic field, the degenerate energy levels would split because of the sign of $m$. If we simplify by neglecting the spin quantum number $m_s = 0$, and setting the constant $e\phi = 0$, we can express the energy in Eq. (\ref{total energyeigenvalue}) by 

\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{nm}}{\hbar \omega_0} = (1+|m|+2n) \sqrt{1+\frac{\omega_B^2}{\omega_0^2}} + m\frac{\omega_B}{\omega_0} 
  \label{fock darwin}
\end{equation}

If we plot $\frac{E_{nm}}{\hbar \omega_0}$ as a function of $\frac{\omega_B}{\omega_0}$ we get the Fock-Darwin energy spectrum, which was first solved by V.Fock \cite{fock} and later by C.G. Darwin \cite{darwin}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\scalebox{0.7}{\includegraphics{fockdarwin.eps}}
\caption{Fock-Darwin energy spectrum for a single-electron quantum dot. When $\omega_B = 0$ all the quantum states with equal $R$ is degenerate, after $\omega_B$ increases the levels begin to split due to the angular momentum contribution from $m\hbar \omega_B$. The degeneracy can reappear for certain levels and certain $\omega_B$'s. The energy levels will shift back and forth between $(n,m)$ pairs, but they all appear to reach an asymptote in the high field limit, forming the famous Landau levels \cite{landaulevels}, indicated by the red line. The landau levels are plottet for $N_L =0,1,2$ in Eq. (\ref{landaulevelsplot})}
\end{figure}
%
The energy of the different states will then decrease or increase with stronger magnetic field $\omega_B$, depending on $m$. States that belong to different shells for $\bb{B}=0$ will become degenerate, and when the magnetic field increases even more, we would reach a asymptote for the energies as we clearly see in Figure \ref{fock darwin}. These energy levels are popularly called Landau levels, which he discovered in 1930 at an age of 22 \cite{landauonline}. 

We are interested in the energy levels when $\omega_B \rightarrow \infty$ for the lowest energy levels $m<0$

\begin{equation}
\lim_{\omega_B \rightarrow \infty} E_{nm} = (1+2n)\hbar\omega_B
\end{equation}
%
The Landau levels appear when $N_L \equiv n = 0,1,2,3...$. And the energy only depends on $n$ in the high limit of $\bb{B}$

\begin{equation}
E_L \approx (1+2N_L) \hbar \omega_B
\label{landaulevelsplot}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Scaling the Hamiltonian}
\label{section:scaling the hamiltonian}
When we do computations its a good thing too have dimentionless parameters. The fewer things that can go wrong in the calculation the better. Therefore we want to rescale our manybody Hamiltonian Eq. (\ref{Hamiltonian for QD}) so that its dimentionless. The following derivation is based on examples \cite{scaling,lohne}

\begin{align}
  \omega  & = \omega_c \bar{\omega} \\
  \bb{r}  & = r_c \bb{\bar{r}} \\
  \bb{\nabla}  & = \frac{1}{r_c} \bb{\bar{\nabla}} \\
  r_i^2 & = r_c^2 \bar{r}_i^2 \\
  r_{ij} & = r_c \bar{r}_{ij}
\end{align}
%
Here the variables with the subscript $c$ is just a constant with the same dimentions as the variable we want to rescale. The variables with a bar is the dimentionless variables that we want. Inserting these into our Hamiltonian Eq. (\ref{Hamiltonian for QD}) gives

\begin{equation}
\hh{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*r_c^2} \sum_{i=1}^N \bar{\nabla}_i^2 + \frac{1}{2}m^* \omega_c^2 \bar{\omega}^2 r_c^2 \sum_{i=1}^N \bar{r}_i^2 + \frac{\hbar}{\epsilon r_c} \sum_{i<j}^N \frac{1}{\bar{r}_{ij}}
  \label{rescaled Qdot Hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
%
Where 
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon = \frac{4\pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r}{e^2}
\end{equation}
%
Furthermore we define the oscillator length to be
\begin{equation}
r_c = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m^* \omega}}
  \label{oscillator length}
\end{equation}
Inserting this into our Hamiltonian Eq. (\ref{rescaled Qdot Hamiltonian})
\begin{equation}
\hh{H} = -\frac{\omega_c \bar{\omega} \hbar}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \bar{\nabla}^2_i + \frac{\hbar}{2} \omega_c \bar{\omega} \sum_{i=1}^N \bar{r}^2_i + \frac{\hbar}{\epsilon} \sqrt{\frac{m^*\omega_c \bar{\omega}}{\hbar}} \sum_{i<j}^N \frac{1}{\bar{r}_{ij}}
  \label{rerescaled Hamiltonian2}
\end{equation}
%
We want to scale the Hamiltonian aswell so that it have units of the Hartree energy $E_h$ \cite{hartrees}
\begin{equation}
  \bar{H} =  \hh{H} / E_h
\end{equation}
%
Where the Hartree energy is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
E_h = m^* \left(\frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r \hbar}\right)^2 = \frac{m^*}{\epsilon^2}
  \label{E hartree}
\end{equation}
%
The scaled Hamiltonian becomes
\begin{equation}
\bar{H} = -\frac{\omega_c\bar{\omega} \hbar \epsilon^2}{2m^*} \sum_{i=1}^N \bar{\nabla}^2_i + \frac{\hbar \epsilon^2}{2m^*} \omega_c \bar{\omega} \sum_{i=1}^N \bar{r}^2_i + \frac{\hbar\epsilon}{m^*} \sqrt{\frac{m^*\omega_c \bar{\omega}}{\hbar}} \sum_{i<j}^N \frac{1}{\bar{r}_{ij}}
\end{equation}
%
To make it dimentionless we have to defined
%
\begin{equation}
\omega_c = \frac{m^*}{\hbar \epsilon}
  \label{dimentional condition}
\end{equation}
%
Which is fine since $\omega_c$ have the dimention of $[1/s]$ which is the same as $\omega$. Our final dimentionless N-electron scaled Hamiltonian reads

\begin{equation}
\bar{H} = -\frac{\omega_c}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \bar{\nabla}^2 + \frac{1}{2} \omega_c \sum_{i=1}^N \bar{r}_i^2 + \sqrt{\omega_c} \sum_{i<j}^N \frac{1}{\bar{r}_{ij}}
  \label{N-body Hamiltonian scaled}
\end{equation}



\section{The double quantum dot}
\label{sec:The double quantum dot}
\label{section:the double dot potential}
The rapid development of nanotechnology has made the quantum computer a more realistic achievement. One of the possible candidates to the quantum bit is a double quantum dot. Expermients of this have been done both with a trapped nuclei \cite{doublenuclei} and electrons \cite{doubleelectron}. We will investigate a model based on \cite{doubledot}. Our one-electron Hamiltonian is the same as before but now with a change in the potential

\begin{equation}
  \hh{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*} \nabla_i^2 + V_c(x,y) 
  \label{one electron hamilton double}
\end{equation}
where the confinement potential is
\begin{equation}
V_c(x,y) = \frac{1}{2} m^* \omega_0^2 \cdot \left[x^2+y^2 - 2L_x |x| + L_x^2 \right]
  \label{double potential}
\end{equation}
%
From \cite{doubledot} we use GaAs material parameters $m^* = 0.067m_e$, and the confinement strength $\hbar \omega_0 = 3.0$ meV. Which correspond to a harmonic oscillator length of $\sqrt{\hbar/\omega_0 m^*} \approx 5.3$ nm. And with the minima separated from a distance $2L_x$ from each other. The values of $V_c(x,0)$ are plotted in Figure \ref{doubledotfigure}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\scalebox{0.7}{\includegraphics{doubledot.eps}}
\caption{Confinement potential for $V_c(x,0)$ and $L_x=50$ nm}
\label{doubledotfigure}
\end{figure}
%
We will then solve the two-dimentional Schr\"{o}dinger equation by using a finite difference method with a three-point Laplacian \cite{computerjensen}. This will give us an Hermitian matrix for which the eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be solved using the QR-algorithm \cite{faires}. The algorithm was independently introduced in 60s by Kublanovskaya \cite{QR2} and Francis \cite{francis}. And have been recognized as one of the 21st century most important algorithms \cite{mostimportant}. 




\subsection{The QR-Algorithm}
\label{section:The QR-Algorithm}
The idea is surprisingly simple, first step is to factor the matrix $A$ into a product of an orthogonal matrix $Q_1$ and positive upper triangular matrix $R_1$. This also refered to as an QR-decomposition and solved by using the Gram-Schmidt algorithm \cite{linalg}.
\begin{equation}
A_1 = Q_1 R_1
  \label{first iteration}
\end{equation}
Next step is to multiply $Q$ and $R$ in a reversed order
\begin{equation}
A_2 = R_1 Q_1
  \label{second iteration}
\end{equation}
%
We repeat this process by finding the $Q$ and $R$ values to $A_2$
\begin{equation}
A_2 = Q_2 Q_2
\end{equation}
%
The complete algorithm can be written as
\begin{equation}
  A = Q_1R_1,\qquad R_kQ_k = A_{k+1} = Q_{k+1}R_{k+1}, \qquad k=1,2,3,...
\end{equation}
%
Where $ R_k,Q_k$ is from the previous steps, and $Q_{k+1}$ is still an ortogonal matrix ($Q^TQ=1$) and $R_{k+10}$ is an positive upper triangular.
%
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{\emph{QR-Algorithm}}
\begin{algorithmic}
\FOR{$i=1 \to n$}
\STATE $Q_iR_i = A_i$ 
\STATE $A_{i+1} = R_iQ_i$ 
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
%
The iteration will finally create a matrix $\tilde{A}$ whose diagonal entries are eigenvalues of $A$. The reason why this works is because all the $A_k$ are similar to each other and therefore they have a common set of eigenvalues with different eigenvectors, i.e. 
\begin{proof}
\bf{If} $Ax = \lambda x$ and $\tilde{A} = S^TA S $ ($S S^T=1$) $\Rightarrow S^T A S x = \lambda x \Rightarrow  A(Sx) = \lambda (Sx)$
\label{similartransformation}
\end{proof}
%
And 
%
\begin{equation}
A_{k+1} = R_k Q_k = Q_k^T (Q_k R_k) Q_k = Q_k^T A_k Q_k 
  \label{shows the similarity transform}
\end{equation}

We will not go in to rigorous details of why this works, but readers are recommended to read \cite{qrproof}. Instead we will give an numerical example, given a Hermitian matrix 
\begin{equation}
A = 		\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
			5 & 4 & 1\\
			4 & 3 & 2\\
			1 & 2 & 1\\
		\end{array}	\right]
		\label{Hermitian A}
\end{equation}
the \emph{exact} eigenvalues found by $\texttt{eig(A)}$ in \textsc{matlab} are 
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{matrix}
 \lambda_1 & = &  8.6625 \\
 \lambda_2 & = &  1.1444 \\
 \lambda_3 & = & -0.8070
\end{matrix}
\label{eigenvalues}
\end{equation}
%
Then the initial QR-factorization $A_1 = Q_1R_1$ produces 
\begin{equation}
Q_1 = 		\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
    0.7715  & -0.0392 &  -0.6350 \\
    0.6172 & -0.1960  &  0.7620 \\
    0.1543  &  0.9798  &  0.1270
		\end{array}\right] 
				\qquad 
		R_1 = 		\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
    6.4807  &  5.2463  &  2.1602 \\
         0  &  1.2150  &  0.5487 \\
         0  &       0  &   1.0160
		\end{array}\right] 
\end{equation}
Which in turn gives us the new $A_2$
\begin{equation}
A_2 = R_1Q_1 = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
    8.5714 &   0.8346  &  0.1568 \\
    0.8346 &   0.2995  &  0.9955 \\
    0.1568  &  0.9955  &  0.1290		
		\end{array}	\right]
\end{equation}
%
We continue this procedure
%
\begin{equation}
A_3 = R_2Q_2 = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
    8.6611  &  0.1033 &   0.0168 \\
    0.1033  &  0.5392 &   0.9035 \\
    0.0168  &  0.9035 &  -0.2003		
		\end{array}	\right]
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
A_4 = R_3Q_3 = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
    8.6625  &  0.0131  &  0.0017 \\ 
    0.0131 &   0.7871  &  0.7548 \\
    0.0017  &  0.7548 &  -0.4496 
		\end{array}	\right]
\end{equation}
%
After $17$ iterations the off-diagonal elements are practically zero, and the eigenvalues on the diagonal correspond to the eigenvalues found in (\ref{eigenvalues}). 
\begin{equation}
A_{17} = R_{16}Q_{16} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
    8.6625  &   0.0000  & -0.0000 \\
    0.0000  &  1.1444   & 0.0098 \\
    0.0000  &  0.0098  & -0.8069
		\end{array}	\right]
\end{equation}
%
But if we want to increase the precision, this method becomes rather slow. As we can see, the convergence of this method is not that impressive, assuming \textsc{matlab} is using the Householder's QR factorization method \cite{bible}, we are going to have $O(n^3)$ flops per iteration, in addiction we have a matrix-matrix multiplication.

One of the optimazations we could do is to use Householder's method for tridiagonalization \cite{computerjensen}, i.e. we want to find a tridiagonal matrix $T$ that is a similar transformed of the matrix $A$.

\begin{equation}
  T = S^T A S, \qquad S = S_1S_2...S_{n-2} 
  \label{similar}
\end{equation}
%
This would speed up the iteration since we have fewer off-diagonal elements to worry about. A second optimazation is the QR-algorithm. we cpuld improve the convergence by introducing a \emph{shift} on the diagonal. This is popularly called \emph{The accelerated QR-algorithm} or \emph{The shifted QR-algorithm} \cite{kincaid}

For a general tridiagonal matrix

\begin{equation}
T_m = \left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
      \alpha_1^{m}  &  \beta_1^{m}   & 0 	    & 0      & \hdots & 0  \\ 
      \beta_1^{m}   &  \alpha_2^{m}  & \beta_2^{m}  & 0 \\ 
                 &  \beta_2^{m}   & \alpha_3^{m} & \beta_3 & & \vdots  \\ 
       \vdots       &                &  \ddots      & \ddots &  \ddots  \\
           &      	     &              &  \beta_{n-2}^m & \alpha_{n-1}^m  & \beta_{n-1}^m \\ 
        0	    &      &      \hdots          &       & \beta_{n-1}^n & \alpha_n^m  \\ 
		\end{array}	\right]
\end{equation}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{\emph{The accelerated QR-Algorithm}}
\begin{algorithmic}
\FOR{$i=1 \to n$}
\STATE $T_m - \alpha_n^m I = Q_m R_m $ 
\STATE $T_{m+1} = R_m Q_m + \alpha_{n}^m I$ 
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
%
It was interesting to see how well this algorithm works compared to a, and have therefore mad a plot for comparison in Figure \ref{fig:QRsummary}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\scalebox{0.7}{\includegraphics{QR.eps}}
\caption{This a plot of different eigenvalues as a function of iteration. The blue line with diamond points represent our normal QR-algorithm on matone electron hamilton doublerix $A$ Eq. (\ref{Hermitian A}), and the red line with points represent the accelerated QR-algorithm on a tridiagonalized matrix $A$. The improved QR-algorithm converges faster for the lower eigenvalues}
\label{fig:QRsummary}
\end{figure}


The final issue is the numerical precision or more correctly, the numerical imprecision. It is important to know the error bound when we do this type of calculations. The details of the mathematics can be read in \cite{lyche}. We will take use of the Hoffman-Wielandt Theorem which states that

\begin{theorem}
  Let $A$ and $E$ be a real symmetric $n\times n$. And let $T = A + E$ with eigenvalues $\{ \gamma_i \}$. And   $\{ \lambda_i \}$ the eigenvalues of $A$, arranged in increasing order. Then
  \begin{equation}
      \left[\sum_{j=1}^n \left(\lambda_i - \gamma_i \right) \right]^{\frac{1}{2}} \leq F(E)     
  \end{equation}
 Where $F(E) = \left(\sum_{ij}^n |a_{ij}|^2 \right)^{1/2}$ is the Frobenius norm of $E$
\end{theorem}
%
Let $T$ be a tridiagonal matrix and let $\tilde{T}$ be the new matrix obtained by deleting $\beta_{n-1}$ from the off-diagonal positions $(n-1,n)$ and $(n,n-1)$ of T. And let $\{\lambda_j\}$ and $\{\tilde{\lambda}_i\}$ denote the eigenvalues respectivly. Then from the Wielandt-Hoffman theorem

\begin{equation}
  \left[\sum_{j=1}^n \left(\lambda_i - \tilde{\lambda}_i \right) \right]^{\frac{1}{2}} \leq F(T-\tilde{T}) = \sqrt{2}|\beta_{n-1}|
\end{equation}
%
Since $\beta_{n-1}$ is the only term that was left after the subtraction. The conclusion of this is that we are closest to the exact eigenvalues when the off-diagonals are smallest.

\subsection{Discretizing the Schr\"{o}dinger equation}
Our one-electron Hamiltonian from Eq. (\ref{one electron hamilton double}) reads

\begin{equation}
  \hh{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*} \nabla_i^2 +  \frac{1}{2} m^* \omega_0^2 \cdot \left[x^2+y^2 - 2L_x |x| + L_x^2 \right]
  \label{rerescaled Hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
Using the rescaled parameters in section \ref{section:scaling the hamiltonian} we get
\begin{equation}
  \bar{H} = -\frac{\omega_c}{2} \nabla^2 +  \frac{1}{2} \omega_c^2 \cdot V_c(\bar{x},\bar {y}) 
\end{equation}
%
The time-independent Schr\"{o}inger equation of this Hamiltonian is then
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\omega_c}{2} \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^2} +\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{y}^2} \right]u(\bar{x},\bar{y}) +  \frac{1}{2} \omega_c^2 \cdot V_c(\bar{x},\bar{y}) u(\bar{x},\bar{y})  = E u(\bar{x},\bar{y}) 
  \label{tisl scaled hamilton}
\end{equation}
%
Where $u(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ is the single-electrons eigenfunctions. From here on the dimentionless coordinates $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ would be refered to as $x$ and $y$. And we would set the constant $\omega_c = 1$. The differential equation can be solved as a matrix diagonalization problem. By subracting two Taylor series we get the numerical second derviate \cite{computerjensen}

\begin{align}
  u(x+h) + u(x-h) &= 2u(x) + h^2 f''(x) + O(h^4) \\
  u(y+h) + u(y-h) &= 2u(y) + h^2 f''(y) + O(h^4) 
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
 f''(x) = \frac{u(x+h)-2u(x)+u(x-h)}{h^2} + O(h^2) \\
 f''(y) = \frac{u(y+h)-2u(y)+u(y-h)}{h^2} + O(h^2) 
 \label{discretize}
\end{equation}
%
For the two-dimentional case the Laplacian becomes
\begin{equation}
  \nabla^2  \approx \frac{1}{h_x^2} \left(u_{i-1,j} - 2u_{i,j} + u_{i+1,j} \right) +  \frac{1}{h_y^2} \left(u_{i,j-1} - 2u_{i,j} + u_{i,j+1} \right) + O(h^2)
  \label{poisson insert}
\end{equation}
%
Where we have used the more compact way of writing $u(x\pm h,y) = u_{i \pm 1, j}$, $u(x,y\pm h) = u_{i, j\pm1}$. An example could be a grid with integration points $n_x = 3$, and step $h=h_x=h_y=\frac{x_{\max}-x_{\min}}{n_x} = \frac{1}{3}$, $x=x_{\min}+ih$, $y=y_{\min}+jh$, where $(i,j)\in\{1,2,3\}$. See Figure \ref{unitgrid}
%
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\input{unitgrid}
\caption{The discretized unit grid in our example. The indices are arranged in lexical order}
\label{unitgrid}
\end{figure}
%
Inserting Eq. (\ref{poisson insert}) into the Schr\"{o}dinger equation Eq. (\ref{tisl scaled hamilton}), gives
\begin{equation}
  d_{ij} u_{i,j} - e u_{i,j-1} - e u_{i,j+1} - e u_{i-1,j} - e u_{i+1,j} = \lambda u_{i,j}
\end{equation}
%
Where we have defined
\begin{equation}
  d_{ij} = \frac{4}{h^2} + V_{ij} \qquad e = -\frac{1}{h^2}
\end{equation}
%
The left side is the discretized poisson equation in two dimensions. This gives us a set of linear equations which can be written as a matrix eigenvalue problem.

\begin{equation}
 \left[\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
    -4   &  1  &    0  &   1  &      &      &      &      &     \\
     1   & -4  &    1  &   0  &   1  &      &      &      &     \\
     0   &  1  &   -4  &   0  &   0  &   1  &      &      &     \\
     1   &  0  &    0  &  -4  &   1  &   0  &   1  &      &     \\
         &  1  &    0  &   1  &  -4  &   1  &   0  &   1  &     \\
         &     &    1  &   0  &   1  &  -4  &   0  &   0  &   1 \\
         &     &       &   1  &   0  &   0  &  -4  &   1  &   0 \\
         &     &       &      &   1  &   0  &   1  &  -4  &   1 \\
         &     &       &      &      &   1  &   0  &   1  &  -4
		\end{array}	\right]
    \left[\begin{array}{c}
     u_{1,1}    \\
     u_{2,1}    \\
     u_{3,1}    \\
     u_{1,2}    \\
     u_{2,2}    \\
     u_{3,2}    \\
     u_{1,3}    \\
     u_{2,3}    \\
     u_{3,3}   
	\end{array}\right]		
	=
	\lambda
	  \left[\begin{array}{c}
     u_{1,1}    \\
     u_{2,1}    \\
     u_{3,1}    \\
     u_{1,2}    \\
     u_{2,2}    \\
     u_{3,2}    \\
     u_{1,3}    \\
     u_{2,3}    \\
     u_{3,3}   
	\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}
%
This is a sparse symmeteric matrix which is almost tridiagonal. In reality we would choose larger integration points and the number of entries in the matrix grows with $n^4$. And lot of those entries are zero.

Since the $x$-coordinates are separable, i.e.

\begin{align}
  \hh{H}(x,y) &= \hh{H}_X(x) + \hh{H}_Y(y) \\ \Rightarrow E &= E_X + E_Y
\end{align}
%
We do not need to discretize in two dimentions, since we already know the eigenvalues for $\hh{H}_Y$, they are the same as for the one-dimentional case, see section \ref{onebodyharmonicoscillatorpotential}. 
The laplacian in one dimention is (Eq. \ref{discretize})

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d^2}{dx^2} = \frac{u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1} }{h^2} + O(h^2)
  \label{onedimdiscretized}
\end{equation}
%
Where $h$ is our step defined as 
\begin{equation}
h = \frac{x_{max}-x_{max}}{N}
  \label{step}
\end{equation}
%
Where $N$ is number of steps or gridpoints. Inserting Eq. \ref{onedimdiscretized} into the one-dimentional Schr\"{o}dinger equation
%
\begin{equation}
-\frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_{i} + u_{i-1}}{h^2} + V_i u_i = E_X u_i
\end{equation}
%
This can be written as an tridiagonal matrix eigenvalue equation.
%
\begin{equation}
  d_iu_i + e_{i-1}u_{i-1} + e_{i+1}u_{i+1} = \lambda u_i
  \label{onedim discrete}
\end{equation}
%
Where
%
\begin{align}
  e_i  = -\frac{1}{h^2}, \qquad  d_i  = \frac{1}{h^2} + V_i
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
 \left[\begin{array}{ccccccc}
    d_1   &  e_1   &  0  &   0  &  \cdots  &   0  &   0\\

\chapter{Quantum Mechanics for Many-Body Systems}
In this chapter, we introduce the notation that is common in many-body physics. We will also introduce the formalism of second-quantization and Wick's theorem.

\section{Introduction}
The underlying fundamentals of quantum mechanics as we know today have not been changed much since its birth. We still need to know the Hamiltonian and solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. But how we use this theory is a different story. In the real world we have deal with systems of more than one quantum particle, we therefore need to expand our Schr\"{o}dinger equation to include those particles, we call it the manybody Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The degrees of freedom increase as our system size get bigger. We are not able to solve our manybody Schr\"{o}dinger equation with conventional techniques, not analytically nor numerically. Another limiting factor is our knowlegde of the interactions, the exact Hamiltonian is not known.

Therefore we have to make some assumptions and use approximations, and here is where the \emph{many-body methods} comes in. The first approximation we use is to the Hartree-Fock method on closed shells, assuming that all our electron interact in the same way. The next method we are going to use is the coupled cluster (CC) method. They are all different in the sense that they have their regions of effectiveness. HF is very fast and gives reasonable result compared to  when we have small systems for very closed shells and the ground state is stable. While the CC method have applications for systems up to 40 electrons, but have problems with convergence and non-variational.


%26.01.2011
%Many of manybody methods we are called \emph{ab initio} methods. That means the calculation start from some fundamental interaction. These methods are not based on any empirical assumptions or parametrizations %[ask Morten] What about when we fit trial wave functions to STO's and parametrize the trial wave function. The whole HF is based on educated guess? empirical guess? some knowelgde about empiri gives us the guess? and the Electron Correlation energy Diagram to show how good HF is compared to other methods see page 32 in Patrick.
\section{The Many-Body Problem}
\label{sec:many-body problem}
Let us assume we have a non-relativistic isolated system of $N$ particles. And assume we can describe the system with a time-independent Hamiltonoperator $\hat{H}$, then we could reduce the problem to solve the time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{H}(r_1, r_2,...,r_N)\psi_\lambda(r_1,r_2,...,r_N) = E_\lambda \psi_\lambda(r_1, r_2,...,r_N)
\label{def:manybodyschrodinger}
\end{equation}
%
where the $r_i$ represent particle $i$ with spin $\ket{m_s}$. $\lambda$ denotes the set of quantum numbers for particles 1,...N. 

The many-body wave fuction $\Psi_\lambda$ is a N-body \emph{vector} in the composite Hilbert space:

\begin{equation}
\psi_\lambda \in \mathcal{H}_N := \mathcal{H}_1 \oplus \mathcal{H}_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus \mathcal{H}_1 
  \label{maybodyinhilbert}
\end{equation}
%
Or

\begin{equation}
\ket{\Psi_\lambda} = \ket{\psi_1}  \oplus \ket{\psi_2} \oplus ... \oplus \ket{\psi_N} \equiv \ket{\psi_1\psi_2 ... \psi_N}
 \label{def:productstates}
\end{equation}
%
where $\ket{\psi_i}$ is a state in a single-particle Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_1$, which is the space of square integrable function over  
$\mathbb{R}^d \oplus (\sigma)$, or formally:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}_1:= L^2(\mathbb{R}^d \oplus (\sigma))
\label{hilbertspacedim}
\end{equation}
%

\subsection{The Electronic Hamiltonian}
We want to describe our physical system with a \emph{ab initio} method, which basically means that we want our Hamiltonian to include the basic forces with no parametrization, in atomic units ($\hbar = c = m_e = 1$) the Hamiltonian is:

\begin{equation}
\hat{H}  = \hat{T} + \hat{V} 
 \label{eq:tplussv}
\end{equation}

Where $\hat{T}$ is the total kinetic energy operator, and $\hat{V}$ is the total potential energy operator.
 
\begin{equation}
\hat{T} = \sum_{k} \hat{t}_k 
 \label{eq:kinetic}
\end{equation}
%
$\hat{t}_k$ is the kinetic energy operator for particle $k$. 

In general we have:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{V} = \hat{V}_1 + \hat{V}_2 + ...  
 \label{eq:potential}
\end{equation}
 %
where 

\begin{equation}
 \hat{V}_n = \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{abc..z} \hat{v}^{(n)}_{abc...z}
\end{equation}
$n!$ is because we have indistignuishable particles. For systems of electrons like quantum dots, we will truncate our total potential operator to include up to the two-body potential operator $\hat{V}_2$. But some papers in nuclear physics (ref(papers of three body force)) have proven that the three-body force is a important contributor to the binding energy????. Then the electronic Hamiltonian the reads (in atomic units)

\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \sum_{k} \hat{t}_k + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} \hat{v}_{ij} 
 \label{def:electronic hamiltonian}
\end{equation}

where (in atomic units)

\begin{equation}
\hat{h}_k = -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2_k + \sum_{A} \hat{c}_{kA}, \qquad \hat{v}_{ij} = \frac{1}{r_{ij}}
 \label{def:electronic hamiltonian parts}
\end{equation}
%
Where the last sum is the coulomb contribution of interaction of the single-particles with the \emph{core} particles $A$, e.g. electrons around a proton core.

\subsection{Identical Particles}
In quantum mechanics particles are indistinguishable, we could not tell which of the electrons is in which state. This means that the expectation value would have to be the same when we interchange the coordinates of particle $i$ and $j$. 

\begin{equation}
|\Psi_{\lambda}(r_1,r_2,..,r_i,..,r_j,..,r_N)|^2 = |\Psi_{\lambda}(r_1,r_2,..,r_j,..,r_i,..,r_N)|^2
 \label{eq:interchange}
\end{equation}
%
Gives us possible antisymmetric ($-$) and symmetric ($+$) solutions

\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\lambda}(r_1,r_2,..,r_i,..,r_j,..,r_N) = \pm \Psi_{\lambda}(r_1,r_2,..,r_j,..,r_i,..,r_N)
\end{equation}
%
We will later refer to the symmetric solution as bosons, and the other as fermions.
Introducing the Permutation operator 

\begin{equation}
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_\lambda(r_1,r_2,..,r_i,..,r_j,..,r_N) = \Psi_\lambda(r_1,r_2,..,r_j,..,r_i,..,r_N) 
 \label{eq:poperator}
\end{equation}
%
The eigenvalue equation for $\hat{P}$ gives 

\begin{equation}
 \hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_\lambda(r_1,r_2,..,r_i,..,r_j,..,r_N) = \beta \Psi_\lambda(r_1,r_2,..,r_i,..,r_j,..,r_N) 
 \label{eq:poperatoreq}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\beta = \pm 1 \qquad \text{Since} \qquad \hat{P}^2_{ij} = 1
 \label{eq:beta} 
\end{equation}
%
wavefunctions with $(\beta = +1)$ are the bosons, and $(\beta = -1)$ are the fermions. The Hamiltonian is invariant under the interchange of particles and therefore commutes with the permutation operator.

\begin{proof}
\begin{equation}
\hat{P}_ {jk} \hat{H} \Psi = \hat{P}_{jk}(\hat{H}_{jk}\Psi_{jk}) =  \hat{H}_{kj}\Psi_{kj} 
\label{eq:overst}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H} \hat{P}_{jk} \Psi = \hat{H}_{jk}\hat{P}_{jk}\Psi_{jk} = \hat{H}_{jk} \Psi_{kj}
\label{eq:nederst}
\end{equation}
%
We then subtract equation (\ref{eq:overst}) with (\ref{eq:nederst}) 
%
\begin{equation}
 \hat{P}_{jk}(\hat{H}\Psi) - \hat{H}(\hat{P}_{jk}\Psi) = \hat{H}_{kj}\Psi_{kj} - \hat{H}_{jk} \Psi_{kj}
\end{equation}
%
or equivalently
%
\begin{equation}
 \left[\hat{P}_{jk},\hat{H} \right] = \left(\hat{H}_{kj} - \hat{H}_{jk}\right)\Psi_{kj}
\end{equation}
\end{proof}
%
\noindent The permutation operator commutes with the Hamiltonian if and only if $\hat{H}_{kj} = \hat{H}_{jk}$.

According to (\ref{eq:kinetic}) and (\ref{eq:potential}) Hamiltonian is a sum of of onebody and two-body operators. The sums converge and are therefore interchangable with respect to particles without changing our Hamiltonian.

\begin{equation}
H_{jk} = H_1... + H_j + ... + H_k + ... = H_1... + H_k + ... + H_j + ... = H_{kj}
 \label{eq:HkjequalsHjk}
\end{equation}
%
Then it follows that $\hat{H}$ and $\hat{P}$ are compatible observable (\cite{griffiths}[111]). i.e. there exist eigenfunctions for $\hat{H}$ that are also eigenfunctions of $\hat{P}$. We know we need to construct symmetric wavefunctions for the bosons and antisymmetric for the fermions. One way of doing this is using symmetrizer operator for bosons

\begin{equation}
\hat{S} = \frac{1}{N!} \sum_p \hat{P}
 \label{def:symmetrizer}
\end{equation}
%
where $p$ is the called the permutation number and is the \emph{set} of all possible permutations including the empty set. $p = \{\emptyset,[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]\}$ ------[[[Uncertain]]]------ for three particles.
The normalized symmetric state $\Phi_S$ is then given by

\begin{equation}
\Phi_S(r_1,r_2,...,r_N) = \sqrt{\frac{N!}{n_\alpha!n_\beta!...n_\gamma!}} \hat{S} \phi_\alpha(r_1)\phi_\beta(r_2)...\phi_\gamma(r_N)
 \label{def:symmetricwave}
\end{equation}
%
Similary we have the antisymmetrizer operator for fermions

\begin{equation}
\hat{A} = \frac{1}{N!} \sum_p (-1)^p \hat{P}
 \label{def:antisymmetrizer}
\end{equation}
%
and the normalized antisymmetric states

\begin{equation}
\Phi_{AS}(r_1,r_2,...,r_N) = \sqrt{N!} \hat{A} \psi_\alpha(r_1)\psi_\beta(r_2)...\psi_\gamma(r_N)
 \label{def:antisymmetricwave}
\end{equation}
%
or equivalently

\begin{equation}
  \Phi_{\alpha\beta...\gamma}(r_1,r_2,...,r_N) = \frac{1}{\sqrt N!} 
\left|\begin{array}{cccc} 
\phi_\alpha(r_1) & \phi_\beta(r_1) & ... & \phi_\gamma(r_1) \\
\phi_\alpha(r_2) & \phi_\beta(r_2) & ... & \phi_\gamma(r_2) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
\phi_\alpha(r_N) & \phi_\beta(r_N) & ... & \phi_\gamma(r_N) \\
\end{array} \right|
\label{def:slaterdeterminant}
\end{equation}
%
This is first introduced by J.C. Slater \cite{slaterdeterminant} in 1929 and popularily called a Slater determinant. It obeys the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP): The determinant would be zero if two of the single-particle wavefunctions have the same quantum numbers $\alpha, \beta, ... \gamma$. 


The most general way of writing our wavefunction of the N-fermion system is to have a linear combination of the Slater determinants (\ref{def:slaterdeterminant}).

\begin{equation}
\Psi_\lambda(r_1,r_2,....,r_N) = \sum_{\alpha\beta...\gamma} C_{\alpha\beta...\gamma}^{\lambda}  \Phi_{\alpha\beta...\gamma}(r_1,r_2,...,r_N)
 \label{def:generalslaterdeterminant}
\end{equation}

\section{Second Quantization}
\label{sec:second quantization}
The second-quantization formalism was first introduced by Dirac (1927) and extended to fermion systems by Jordan and Klein (1927) and by Jordan and Wigner (1928) \cite{bartlett}. The formalism of \emph{second quantisation} is just a simplification in the description of many-body system, a reformulation of the original Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The quantum mechanical states are represented by annihilation and creation operators working on the physical vacuum state. 

We will look at fermionic systems, therefore we willl restric the many-particle functions to be antisymmetric and choose the \emph{Slater determinant} (\ref{def:slaterdeterminant}) as our candidate. And introduce the occupancy notation for Slater determinants

\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\alpha_1 \alpha_2...\alpha_N} \equiv \ket{\alpha_1\alpha_2...\alpha_N}
 \label{def:state}
\end{equation}
%
Note: this is not the same as the product states in (\ref{def:productstates}). This is antisymmetrized 

\begin{equation}
\ket{\alpha_1..\alpha_i\alpha_j..\alpha_N} = -\ket{\alpha_1..\alpha_j\alpha_i..\alpha_N}
 \label{def:antisymmetricstate}
\end{equation}
%
And the state ''lies`` in what we called the Fock space,  which is a tensor product space of antisymmetric Hilbert spaces:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}_N = \bigoplus_{n=0}^N \mathcal{H}_n^{AS}
 \label{def:fockspace}
\end{equation}
%
In this case we have a state in a $N$-dimentional Fock space. 

\subsection{Creation and Annihilation Operators}
The creation and annihilation operators are mappings between different $N$ and $N\pm1$ dimentional Hilbert spaces,

\begin{equation}
a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}: \mathcal{H}_{N}^{AS} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{N+1}^{AS} 
 \label{def:creation}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
a_{\alpha}: \mathcal{H}_N^{AS} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{N-1}^{AS}
 \label{def:annihilation}
\end{equation}
%
where 

\begin{equation}
 \alpha \in \mathcal{H}_1
\end{equation}
%
A creation operator $a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}$ will create a fermion with quantum number(s) $\alpha$ from the antisymmetric state (\ref{def:state})
 

\begin{equation}
a_{\alpha}^{\dagger} \ket{0} = \ket{\alpha}
 \label{ex:creation}
\end{equation}
%
$\ket{0}$ is the vacuum state. If $\alpha$ is already occupied, the result is zero due to PEP. 

\begin{equation}
a_{\alpha}^{\dagger} \ket{\alpha} = 0
 \label{ex:creationpep}
\end{equation}
%
An annihilation operator $a_{\alpha}$ will remove a fermion with quantum number(s) $\alpha$ from the antisymmetric state (\ref{def:state})

\begin{equation}
a_{\alpha}\ket{\alpha} = \ket{0}
 \label{ex:annihilation}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
a_{\alpha}\ket{0} = 0
 \label{ex:annihilationvacuum}
\end{equation}
%
If $\alpha$ does not exist, the result is zero due to annihilation of a vacuum state. 

\begin{equation}
a_{\alpha} \underbrace{\ket{\alpha_1\alpha_2...\alpha_N}}_{\alpha \notin} = 0
 \label{ex:annihilationpep}
\end{equation}
%
Our Slater determinant (\ref{def:state}) can now be written as a product of creation operators

\begin{equation}
\ket{\alpha_1\alpha_2...\alpha_N} = \prod_{i=1}^N a_{\alpha_i}^\dagger \ket{0}
 \label{eq:slatercreationproduct}
\end{equation}
%
Using the antisymmetry of the states (\ref{def:antisymmetricstate}) we can show that

\begin{equation}
a_{\alpha_i}^\dagger a_{\alpha_k}^\dagger = - a_{\alpha_k}^\dagger a_{\alpha_i}^\dagger 
 \label{eq:creationcommute}
\end{equation}
%
leading to the anticommutation rule for creation operators

\begin{equation}
\{a_{\alpha}^\dagger ,a_{\beta}^\dagger \} = a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\beta}^\dagger  + a_{\beta}^\dagger a_{\alpha}^\dagger = 0
 \label{eq:creationanticommute}
\end{equation}
%
Note: If $\alpha = \beta$ we would also get zero because of PEP. The hermitian conjugate (adjoint) of $a_{\alpha}^\dagger$ is the annihilation operator,

\begin{equation}
\left(a_{\alpha}^\dagger \right)^\dagger = a_\alpha
 \label{def:creationadjoint]}
\end{equation}
%
We have the following anticommutation relation for the annihilation operators (see \cite{bartlett} for details)

\begin{equation}
\{a_\alpha, a_\beta \} = a_\alpha a_\beta + a_\beta a_\alpha = 0
 \label{eq:annihilationanticommute}
\end{equation}
%
and 

\begin{equation}
\{a_{\alpha}^\dagger, a_\beta \} = \{a_{\alpha}, a_\beta^\dagger \}  = \delta_{\alpha \beta}
 \label{eq:creationannihilationanticommute}
\end{equation}
%
where $\delta_{\alpha \beta}$ is $0$ if $\alpha \neq \beta$ and $1$ if $\alpha = \beta$.

\subsection{Representation of Operators}
Now that we have formalism for our states, we want to calculate matrix elements and expectation values of a \emph{many-body} operators.

Starting with the number-operator. It is a way to test our many-body formalism conserve the number of particles. 

\begin{equation}
\hat{N} = \sum_\alpha a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\alpha} 
 \label{def:numberoperator}
\end{equation}
%
And operating this on a state gives us the eigenvalue of $n$, which is the number of fermions in that state.

\begin{equation}
\hat{N} \ket{\alpha_1 \alpha_2... \alpha_N} = \sum_\alpha a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\alpha} \ket{\alpha_1 \alpha_2... \alpha_N} = n  \ket{\alpha_1 \alpha_2... \alpha_N} 
 \label{def:numberoperatorstate}
\end{equation}

Because from  (\ref{ex:creation}),(\ref{ex:annihilationpep}) and (\ref{ex:annihilationpep}) we get 

\begin{equation}
 a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\alpha} \ket{\alpha_1 \alpha_2... \alpha_N}= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
 0 & \mbox{$\alpha \notin \{\alpha_i\}$} \\
  \ket{\alpha_1 \alpha_2... \alpha_N} & \mbox{$\alpha \in \{\alpha_i\}$}
       \end{array} \right.
 \label{def:becausenumberoperators}
\end{equation}
% 
The number operator is a one-body operator since it acts on one single-particle state at a time. Another type is (what kind of type?) A general one-body operator? (For details see...) \cite{bartlett} mentions this to be a symmetric.

\begin{equation}
\hat{F} = \sum_{\alpha \beta} \bra{\alpha} \hat{f} \ket{\beta} \ket{\alpha}\bra{\beta}
 \label{def:onebodyoperator}
\end{equation}
%
where $\ket{\alpha},\ket{\beta}$ is the chosen single-particle basis. It can be rewritten and expressed with creation and annihilation operators (see Appendix derivation). The second quantized form of $\hat{F}$

\begin{equation}
\hat{F} = \sum_{\alpha \beta} \bra{\alpha} \hat{f} \ket{\beta} a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\beta}
 \label{def:rewrittenonebodyoperator}
\end{equation}


%One spesial case is the one-body operator for the kinetic energy plus an external one-body %potential.

%\begin{equation}
%\hat{H}_0 = \sum_{\alpha \beta} \bra{\alpha} \hat{h}_0 \ket{\beta} a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\beta}
% \label{def:spesialonebodyoperator}
%\end{equation}

%where $\hat{h}_0 = \hat{t} + \hat{u}$. 

The operator $\hat{F}$ removes a fermion from the state $\beta$ and creates a new one in state $\alpha$. This transition is given by the probability amplitude $\bra{\alpha}\hat{f}\ket{\beta}$.

Generally we can do this for a N-body operator. But we will just consider a two-body operator at the most

\begin{equation}
\hat{V} = \sum_{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta} \bra{\alpha \beta} v \ket{\gamma \delta}   \ket{\gamma \delta} \bra{\alpha \beta}
 \label{def:twobodyoperator}
\end{equation}
%
For a $N$-particle system we have

\begin{equation}
V_N = \sum_{i<j=1}^N \hat{v}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i\neq j}^N \hat{v}_{ij}
 \label{def:N-twobodyoperator}
\end{equation} 
%
This can be used to rewrite $\hat{V}$ to

\begin{align}
\hat{V} &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\bra{\alpha \beta} v \ket{\gamma \delta} a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\beta}^\dagger a_{\delta} a_{\gamma} \\
        &= \frac{1}{4} \sum_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} \bra{\alpha \beta}|v|\ket{\gamma \delta} \, a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\beta}^\dagger a_{\delta} a_{\gamma} 
 \label{eq:secondquantized}
\end{align}
%
Where we have defined the antisymmetric matrix element to be.
\begin{align}
\bra{\alpha \beta} |v| \ket{\gamma \delta} = \bra{\alpha \beta} v \ket{\gamma \delta} - \bra{\alpha \beta} v \ket{\delta\gamma} 
 \label{def:antisymmetrizedmatrix}
\end{align}
%Note that if alpha = beta, gamma, delta we would automatically get 0, no need to have the condition alpha != beta like in the def:N-twobodyoperator. That is restriction of the summation index are not needed because of PEP
see \cite{manybodyjensen} and \cite{dick} for details of this derivation. The interpretation of the operator $\hat{V}$ is that it removes two fermions in the states $\gamma$ and $\delta$, and creates two others in states $\alpha$,$\beta$. This is done with probability amplitude  $\frac{1}{4}\bra{\alpha \beta} v \ket{\gamma \delta}_{\text{AS}}$. 
%
But the interesting here is to calculate expectation values of the operator (\ref{eq:secondquantized}). Let us find the expectation value of $\hat{V}$ with respect to the two-particle product states $\ket{\alpha_1 \alpha_2}$ and $\ket{\beta_1}{\beta_2}$ 

\begin{align}
\bra{\alpha_1\alpha_2}\hat{V}\ket{\beta_1\beta_2} &= \frac{1}{4} \sum_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} 
 \bra{\alpha \beta} |v| \ket{\gamma \delta}\bra{\alpha_1 \alpha_2} a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\beta}^\dagger a_{\delta} a_{\gamma} \ket{\beta_1\beta_2} \\ 
  & = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} \bra{\alpha \beta} |v| \ket{\gamma \delta}\bra{0} a_{\alpha_1} a_{\alpha_2} a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\beta}^\dagger a_{\delta} a_{\gamma} a_{\beta_1}^\dagger a_{\beta_2}^\dagger \ket{0}
\end{align}
%Derivate the expectation value
Using the anticommutation relations (\ref{eq:creationanticommute}),(\ref{eq:annihilationanticommute}) and (\ref{eq:creationannihilationanticommute}), we get

\begin{align}
 &\bra{0} a_{\alpha_1} a_{\alpha_2} a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\beta}^\dagger a_{\delta} a_{\gamma} a_{\beta_1}^\dagger a_{\beta_2}^\dagger \ket{0} \nonumber \\
&= \bra{0} a_{\alpha_1} a_{\alpha_2} a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\beta}^\dagger \left( a_{\delta} \delta_{\gamma\beta_1} a_{\beta_2}^{\dagger} -  a_\delta a_{\beta_1}^\dagger a_\gamma a_{\beta_2}^\dagger \right) \ket{0} \\ 
&= \bra{0} a_{\alpha_1} a_{\alpha_2} a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\beta}^\dagger \left( \delta_{\gamma\beta_1}\delta_{\delta \beta_2} - \delta_{\gamma \beta_1} a_{\beta_2}^{\dagger} a_{\delta} - a_{\delta} a_{\beta_1}^{\dagger} \delta_{\gamma \beta_2} + a_\delta a_{\beta_1}^{\dagger}a_{\beta_2}^{\dagger} a_\gamma \right) \ket{0}\\
&=\bra{0} a_{\alpha_1} a_{\alpha_2} a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\beta}^\dagger \left(\delta_{\gamma\beta_1}\delta_{\delta \beta_2} - \delta_{\gamma \beta_1} a_{\beta_2}^{\dagger} a_{\delta} - \delta_{\delta\beta_1}\delta_{\gamma\beta_2} \delta_{\gamma \beta_2} + \delta_{\gamma\beta_2}a_{\beta_1}^{\dagger}a_\delta + a_\delta a_{\beta_1}^{\dagger}a_{\beta_2}^{\dagger} a_\gamma \right) \ket{0}
\end{align}
% 
The only terms that survive is the terms with only kronecker deltas, because all the other terms have an annihilation operator to the left which gives zero with the vacuum state (\ref{ex:annihilationvacuum})

\begin{equation}
\bra{0} a_{\alpha_1} a_{\alpha_2} a_{\alpha}^\dagger a_{\beta}^\dagger a_{\delta} a_{\gamma} a_{\beta_1}^\dagger a_{\beta_2}^\dagger \ket{0} = \left(\delta_{\gamma\beta_1}\delta_{\delta\beta_2} - \delta_{\delta\beta_1}\delta_{\gamma\beta_2}\right)\bra{0} a_{\alpha_2} a_{\alpha_1} a^{\dagger}_{\alpha} a^{\dagger}_{\beta} \ket{0}
\label{eq:vacuumexpectation}
\end{equation}
%
Similary we can rewrite 

\begin{equation}
\bra{0} a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \ket{0} = \delta_{\alpha \alpha_1}\delta_{\beta \alpha_2} - \delta_{\beta \alpha_1}\delta_{\alpha \alpha_2}
 \label{eq:vacuumexpectation2}
\end{equation}
%
This gives us the following expectation value

\begin{align}
\bra{\alpha_1\alpha_2}\hat{V}\ket{\beta_1\beta_2} &= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \bra{\alpha_1\alpha_2}v\ket{\beta_1\beta_2} - \bra{\alpha_1\alpha_2}v\ket{\beta_2\beta_1} - \bra{\alpha_2\alpha_1}v\ket{\beta_1\beta_2} + \bra{\alpha_2\alpha_1}v\ket{\beta_2\beta_1} \right]\\
 &= \bra{\alpha_1\alpha_2}v\ket{\beta_1\beta_2} - \bra{\alpha_1\alpha_2}v\ket{\beta_2\beta_1}\\
 &= \bra{\alpha_1\alpha_2}v\ket{\beta_1\beta_2}_{\text{AS}} 
 \label{res:twobodyexpectation}
\end{align}
%
As we see, this can be very tedious and unefficient as we have to write out contributions that gives us zero. But we can use Wick's theorem to more easily find those terms that gives us contribution. This will be our next topic. The second-quantized form of electronic Hamiltonian from (\ref{def:electronic hamiltonian},\ref{def:electronic hamiltonian parts}) is then %badness underfull 

\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \sum_{ij} \bra{i}\hat{h}\ket{j}a_i^{\dagger} a_j+ \frac{1}{4} \sum_{ijkl} \bra{ij}|\hat{v}|\ket{kl} a_i^{\dagger} a_j^{\dagger} a_l a_k
 \label{def:secondquantized hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
%
And its vacuum expectation value:
\begin{equation}
\bra{0}\hat{H}\ket{0} = \sum_{i} \bra{i}h\ket{i} + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{ij} \bra{ij}|v|\ket{ij}
 \label{eq:second-qunatized vacuum expectation value}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Wick's Theorem}
Originally Gian-Carlo Wick established this method (1950) in order to evalute the $S$-matrix in quantum field theory (see for \cite{wick} and \cite{chang} for details). He introduced two concepts \emph{normal ordering} and \emph{contractions}. Normal ordering is just a way to write products of annihilation and creation operators in a systematic manner. 

The operators $\hat{A},\hat{B},\hat{C},...$ represents both creation and annihilation operators. Then the \emph{normal ordering} of the operators $\{\hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{C}...\}$ are defined as the rearrangement such that all of the annihilation operators are to the left of the creation operators, multiplied with a phase factor which is $-1$ for each permutation of nearest neighboor operators.

\begin{equation}
\left \{ \hat{A}\hat{B}...\hat{U}\hat{V} \right \} \equiv (-1)^{p} u^{\dagger}v^{\dagger}w^{\dagger}...cba 
 \label{def:normalorder}
\end{equation}
%
The superscript $p$ denotes the number of permutations needed to bring the original operator product into the normal ordered form. 
\\   %How to get Example \newline without badness???
Example:
\begin{align}
\{a^{\dagger}b\} &= a^{\dagger}b, \qquad \{ab^{\dagger}\} = -b^{\dagger}a, \nonumber \\
\{ab\} &= ab = -ba, \\
\{a^{\dagger}bc^{\dagger}d\} & = a^{\dagger} c^{\dagger} db = c^{\dagger}a^{\dagger} bd = -a^{\dagger} c^{\dagger}bd =  -c^{\dagger} a^{\dagger}db \nonumber
  \label{ex:normalorder}
\end{align}
Note that the normal ordered form of operators is not unique since creation and annihilation operators can permute among themselves. Also note one of the important properties of normal ordered operators is that its vacuum expectation value is zero. 
\begin{equation}
\bra{0}\ql\{\hh{A}\hh{B}...\qr\}\ket{0} = 0
 \label{show:vacuumexpectnormalorder}
\end{equation}
%
Because of 
\begin{equation}
a_\alpha\ket{0} = 0
\label{eq:becauseannihilation} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\bra{0}a^\dagger_\alpha = 0
\label{eq:becausecreation} 
\end{equation}
%
A contraction between two operators are defined as
\begin{equation}
\contraction{}{\hh{A} }{}{\hh{B}}
\hh{A}\hh{B} \equiv \hh{A} \hh{B} - \ql \{ \hh{A} \hh{B} \qr \}
 \label{def:contraction}
\end{equation}
%
And we have only four possibile contractions
\begin{align}
\contraction{}{\hat{a}}{{}_{\alpha}^{\dagger}}{a}
a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} &= a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} - a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} = 0 \\
\contraction{}{a}{{}_{\alpha}}{a}
a_{\alpha}a_{\beta} &= a_{\alpha}a_{\beta} = 0 \\
\contraction{}{\hat{a}}{{}_{\alpha}^{\dagger}}{a}
a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta} &= a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta} - a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta} = 0 \\
\contraction{}{\hat{a}}{{}_{\alpha}^{\dagger}}{a}
a_{\alpha}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} &= a_{\alpha}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} - ( - a_{\beta}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} ) = \delta_{\alpha\beta} \qquad \text{from (\ref{eq:creationannihilationanticommute})}
 \label{eq:contractionpossibilities}
\end{align}
%
We can have contractions between operators inside a normal ordered product,
\begin{equation}
\contraction{\ql \{ \qr. \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C},.}{\hh{P}}{}{\hh{Q}} 
\contraction{\ql \{ \qr. \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}...\hh{P}\hh{Q},.}{\hh{X}}{}{\hh{Y}} 
\contraction{\ql \{ \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}...\hh{P}\hh{Q}...\hh{X}\hh{Y}...\qr \} = (-1)^{p} }{\hh{P}}{}{\hh{Q}} 
\contraction{\ql \{ \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}...\hh{P}\hh{Q}...\hh{X}\hh{Y}...\qr \} = (-1)^{p} \hh{P}\hh{Q}}{\hh{X}}{}{\hh{Y}} 
\ql \{ \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}...\hh{P}\hh{Q}...\hh{X}\hh{Y}...\qr \} = (-1)^{p} \hh{P}\hh{Q} \hh{X}\hh{Y} \ql \{ \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}...\qr \}
 \label{def:contrationinsidenormalorder}
\end{equation}
%
Wick's theorem states that we can express any product of creation and annihilation operators as sum of normal ordered products with all possible ways of contractions, i.e.

\begin{align}
\hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}...\hh{V}\hh{X}\hh{Y}\hh{Z} &= \ql\{ \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}...\hh{V}\hh{X}\hh{Y}\hh{Z} \qr \}  \nonumber\\
\contraction{ + \sum_{(1)} \ql\{ \qr.}{\hh{A}}{}{..}
& + \sum_{(1)} \ql\{ \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}...\hh{V}\hh{X}\hh{Y}\hh{Z} \qr \} \nonumber\\
\contraction{ + \sum_{(1)} \ql\{ \qr.}{\hh{A}}{,.}{\hh{C}}  %A little cheating whith ,.
\contraction[2ex]{ + \sum_{(1)} \ql\{ \qr.\hh{A}}{\hh{B}}{,.}{\hh{D}}  %A little cheating whith ,.
& + \sum_{(2)} \ql\{ \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}...\hh{V}\hh{X}\hh{Y}\hh{Z} \qr \} \nonumber\\
&+...\nonumber\\
\contraction{ + \sum_{(N/2)} \ql\{ \qr.}{\hh{A}}{,.}{\hh{C}}  %A little cheating whith ,.
\contraction[2ex]{ + \sum_{(N/2)} \ql\{ \qr.\hh{A}}{\hh{B}}{,.}{\hh{D}}  %A little cheating whith ,.
\contraction{ + \sum_{(N/2)} \ql\{ \qr.\hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}...}{\hh{V}}{.,}{\hh{Y}}
\contraction[2ex]{ + \sum_{(N/2)} \ql\{ \qr.\hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}...\hh{V}}{\hh{X}}{,.}{\hh{Z}}
& + \sum_{(N/2)} \ql \{ \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}...\hh{V}\hh{X}\hh{Y}\hh{Z} \qr \} 
\label{def:wicksteorem}
\end{align}

$\sum_{(m)}$ means sum over all terms with $m$ number of contractions. $N$ is the total number of creation and annihilation operators. If there are different numbers of creation and annihilation operators, the vacuum expectation value would be zero, because of Eq. (\ref{eq:becauseannihilation}) and Eq. (\ref{eq:becausecreation}). If $N$ odd one of the operators would not be contracted and we would get zero aswell. In order to get contribution one must contract all of the operators. For details of the proof see \cite{peskin} or \cite{bartlett}. 

The generalized Wick's theorem follows directly from Wick's theorem and states that the normal ordered product of operators strings $\{...\}$ are the same as the sum of normal ordered product of the total group with all possible ways of contractions, i.e. 

\begin{align}
\ql\{\hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}..\qr \} \ql \{\hh{V}\hh{X}\hh{Y}\hh{Z}..\qr \} & = \ql \{ \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}..\hh{V}\hh{X}\hh{Y}\hh{Z}\qr\} \nonumber \\
\contraction{+\sum_{(1)} \ql \{ \qr .}{\hh{A}}{\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D},}{\hh{V}} 
& +\sum_{(1)} \ql \{ \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}..\hh{V}\hh{X}\hh{Y}\hh{Z}\qr\} \nonumber \\
\contraction{+\sum_{(2)} \ql \{ \qr .}{\hh{A}}{\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D},}{\hh{V}} 
\contraction[2ex]{+\sum_{(2)} \ql \{ \qr . \hh{A}}{\hh{B}}{\hh{C}\hh{D},\hh{V}}{\hh{X}} 
& +\sum_{(2)} \ql \{ \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}..\hh{V}\hh{X}\hh{Y}\hh{Z}\qr\} \nonumber \\
& + ... \nonumber \\
\contraction{+\sum_{(N/2)} \ql \{ \qr .}{\hh{A}}{\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}.}{V}
\contraction[2ex]{+\sum_{(N/2)} \ql \{ \qr .\hh{A}}{\hh{B}}{\hh{C}\hh{D}..\hh{V}}{\hh{X}}
\contraction[3ex]{+\sum_{(N/2)} \ql \{ \qr .\hh{A}\hh{B}}{\hh{C}}{\hh{D}..\hh{V}\hh{X}}{Y}
\contraction[4ex]{+\sum_{(N/2)} \ql \{ \qr .\hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C} }{\hh{D}}{..\hh{V}\hh{X}\hh{Y}}{Z}
& +\sum_{(N/2)} \ql \{ \hh{A}\hh{B}\hh{C}\hh{D}..\hh{V}\hh{X}\hh{Y}\hh{Z}\qr\} \nonumber \\
 \label{def:generalizednormalorder}
\end{align}
%
Note that as before the only contribution to the vacuum expectation value comes from the full contractions, only the last sum will give contribution. There are no \emph{internal}  contractions, i.e. contraction between pair of operators inside each operator string $\{..\}$. 

As an example, we can now use Wick's theorem to find the vacuum expectation value of the following products:

\begin{align}
\contraction{\bra{0} a_{i}a_{j}^{\dagger} \ket{0} .;;  \ql \{ \qr.}{a}{{}_{i}}{a}
\bra{0} a_{i}a_{j}^{\dagger} \ket{0} &=   \ql \{ a_{i}a_{j}^{\dagger} \qr \} =\delta_{ij}  \label{eq:vacuumexpectation2redo one-body} \\
%
\contraction{\bra{0} a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \ket{0} = \ql \{ \qr.}{a}{{}_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1} }{a}
%
\contraction[2ex]{\bra{0} a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \ket{0} = \ql \{ a_{\alpha_2} \qr.}{a}{{}_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}}{a}
%
\contraction{\bra{0} a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \ket{0} = \ql \{a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \qr \} + \ql \{ \qr. a_{\alpha_2}}{a}{{}_{\alpha.}}{a}
%
\contraction[2ex]{\bra{0} a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \ket{0} = \ql 
\{a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \qr \} + \ql \{ \qr. }{a}{{}_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a^{\dagger}_{\alpha}}{a}
%
\contraction{\bra{0} a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \ket{0} = \ql \{a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \qr \} + \ql \{a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \qr \} 
+ ,,.}{a}{{}_{\alpha_1}}{a}
%
\contraction{\bra{0} a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \ket{0} = \ql \{ a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \qr \} + \ql \{a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \qr \} 
+ \ql \{ \qr. a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha.}.}{a}{{}^{\dagger}_{\alpha}}{a}
%
\bra{0} a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \ket{0}&= \ql \{a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \qr \} + \ql \{a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \qr \} 
+ \ql \{\underbrace{a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger}}_{=0} \qr \}  \nonumber \\
%
& = \delta_{\alpha \alpha_1}\delta_{\beta \alpha_2} - \delta_{\beta \alpha_1}\delta_{\alpha \alpha_2}  \label{eq:vacuumexpectation2redo}
\end{align}
%
% And remember that the vacuum expectation value of no fully contracted terms always gives zero 
% \begin{equation}
% \bra{0} \ql \{a_{\alpha_2}a_{\alpha_1}a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} \qr \} \ket{0} = (-1)^{2+2} \underbrace{\bra{0} a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}}_{=0}a_{\beta}^{\dagger} a_{\alpha_2}\underbrace{a_{\alpha_1}\ket{0}}_{=0} = 0
%  \label{def:vacuum of no fully contracted normal order}
% \end{equation}
%



\subsection{Particle-Hole Formalism}
\label{sec:particle-hole formalism}
One of the advantages with second quantization is that we can easily introduce a reference SD: $\ket{c}$ instead of using the physical vacuum state $\ket{0}$. This reduces the dimentionality of the problem and the new referece state would be defined by a boldfaced zero

\begin{equation}
\ket{\bf 0} \equiv \ket{\Phi_0} = \ket{ijk...n} 
 \label{def:referencestate}
\end{equation}
%
The new reference state $\ket{\bf 0}$ is also refered to as the \emph{Fermi vacuum}, this is now our Fermi level which is the level of our last occupied quantum state, usually the highest occupied orbital ---[[[What do we mean by orbital or spinorbital]]]---. 
\\
In this representation we have hole states in addition to particle states. We will define what the hole-states are after the following example. Assume that we have three states states that are successively filled with $n-1$,$n$ and $n+1$ single-particle states $\alpha_i$

\begin{align}
\ket{\Phi_0} &\equiv \ket{\alpha_1\alpha_2...\alpha_{n}} &\qquad \text{(reference state)} \label{def:reference state} \\
\ket{\Phi_{\alpha_1}} &\equiv \ket{\alpha_2\alpha_3...\alpha_{n}} = a_{\alpha_1} \ket{\Phi_0} &\qquad \text{(creation of a hole)} \label{def:creation of a hole} \\
\ket{\Phi^{\alpha}} &\equiv \ket{\alpha\alpha_1\alpha_2...\alpha_{n}} = a_{\alpha}^{\dagger} \ket{\Phi_0} &\qquad \text{(creation of a particle)}
 \label{def:creation of a particle}
\end{align}
%
And assume that the energies of the single-particle orbitals is such that (see Figure (\ref{fig:particleholerepresentation}))
\begin{equation} \epsilon_{\alpha_{n+1}}>\epsilon_{\alpha_n}>\epsilon_{\alpha_{n-1}}>...\epsilon_{\alpha_{2}}>\epsilon_{\alpha_{1}}
 \label{def:singleparticleenergies} 
\end{equation}
%
Let us then define our Fermi level to be $\alpha_n$, a \emph{hole} is then a state that is below or on (at??) the Fermi level $\alpha_i \leq \alpha_n$. And a particle is a state above $\alpha_i > \alpha_n$. 

When change our reference state from the physical vacuum state $\ket{0}$ to a particle-hole vaccum $\ket{\bf 0}$, we have to introduce new operators aswell. 

\begin{equation}
a_{\alpha} \ket{\bf 0} \neq 0 
 \label{show:neednewoperators}
\end{equation}
%
since $\alpha \in \ket{\bf 0}$, while for the physical vacuum we have $a_\alpha \ket{0} = 0$ for all $\alpha$. The new operators need to have the relation $b_\alpha\ket{\bf 0} = 0$.

The new operators are called \emph{quasi-} annihilation and creation operators, viz

\begin{equation}
b_{\alpha}^{\dagger} = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
 a_\alpha^{\dagger}, & \alpha > \alpha_F\\
 a_\alpha, & \alpha \leq \alpha_F
       \end{array} \right.
 \label{def:quasi-creation}
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
b_{\alpha} = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
 a_\alpha, & \alpha > \alpha_F \\
 a_\alpha^{\dagger}, & \alpha \leq \alpha_F
       \end{array} \right.
 \label{def:quasi-annihilation}
\end{equation}
%
Where $\alpha_F$ is the Fermi level representing the last occupied single-particle orbit of the reference state $\ket{c}$. 
%
And we have the following anticommutation relations
\begin{align}
\ql \{ b_{\alpha}, b_{\beta} \qr \} &= 0  \label{def:quasioperator1}\\
\ql \{ b_{\alpha}^{\dagger}, b_{\beta}^{\dagger} \qr \} &= 0  \label{def:quasioperator2}\\
\ql \{ b_{\alpha}^{\dagger}, b_{\beta}  \qr \} &= \delta_{\alpha \beta}  \label{def:quasioperator3}
\end{align}
%
The reference state is normalized

\begin{equation}
 \braket{c}{c} = 1
\end{equation}
%
A quasi particle state is defined by a state which has one or more particles/holes  added to the reference state $\ket{c}$.
%
\begin{equation}
\ket{abcd...ijkl...pqrs...} \equiv b_a^{\dagger}b_b^{\dagger}b_c^{\dagger}b_d^{\dagger}...b_i^{\dagger}b_j^{\dagger}b_k^{\dagger}b_l^{\dagger}...b_p^{\dagger}b_q^{\dagger}b_r^{\dagger}b_s^{\dagger}\ket{c}
 \label{def:manybody-quasiparticle}
\end{equation}
%
The convenction is that indices $i,j,k,l...$ indicates states which are occupied by holes. Indices $a,b,c,d...$ indicates the states which are occupied by particles. And $p,q,r,s...$ indicate any state. We are going to simplify the notation further

\begin{align}
 b_i^{\dagger} &= a_i           = i         \,\,\,\,\,\qquad \text{(creation of a hole = removing a state below $\alpha_F$)} \nonumber \\
 b_i           &= a_i^{\dagger} = i^\dagger \,\,\qquad \text{(annihilation of a hole = creating a state below $\alpha_F$)} \nonumber \\
 b_a^{\dagger} &= a_a^{\dagger} = a^\dagger \qquad \text{(creation of a particle = adding a state above $\alpha_F$) } \nonumber \\
 b_a           &= a_a           = a         \,\,\qquad \text{(annihilation of a particle = removing a state above $\alpha_F$)}
\label{def:simplyfied notation of quasi-operators}
\end{align}
%
And the following contractions
\begin{align}
\contraction{}{p}{{}^{\dagger}}{q}
\contraction{p^{\dagger}q^{\dagger} = }{p}{}{q}
p^{\dagger}q^{\dagger} &= pq = 0  \label{eq:contraction 1} \\
\contraction{}{i}{{}^{\dagger}}{j}
i^{\dagger}j &= \delta_{ij} \label{eq:contraction 2} \\
\contraction{}{i}{}{j}
ij^{\dagger} &= 0 \label{eq:contraction 3} \\
\contraction{}{\hat{a}}{}{b}
ab^{\dagger} &= \delta_{ab} \label{eq:contraction 4}\\
\contraction{}{\hat{a}}{{}^{\dagger}}{b}
a^{\dagger}b &= 0 \label{eq:contraction 5}
\end{align}

\section{The Normal-Ordered Hamiltonian}
We want to rewrite the second-quantized form of the electronic Hamiltonian (\ref{def:secondquantized hamiltonian}) 

\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \sum_{pq} \bra{p}h\ket{q}p^{\dagger}q + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrs} \bra{pq}|v|\ket{rs}p^{\dagger}q^{\dagger}sr 
 \label{def:normal-ordered hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
%
using Wick's theorem, 

\begin{align}
\contraction{p^{\dagger}q.;; \ql \{ p^{\dagger}q \qr \} + \ql \{ \qr.}{p}{{}^{\dagger}}{q}
 p^{\dagger}q &= \ql \{ p^{\dagger}q \qr \} +  \underbrace{\ql \{ p^{\dagger}q \qr \}}_{ p=i,q=j}  = \ql \{ p^{\dagger}q \qr \}  + \delta_{ij}  \label{eq:normalordere one-particle} \\
%

& = \delta_{ij}\delta_{kl} + \delta_{ij}\delta_{kl}
\end{align}
%
Here we have done contractions relative to a reference state $\ket{\bf 0}$ and followed the relations Eq. (\ref{eq:contraction 1}-\ref{eq:contraction 5}). Then the normal-ordered one-body Hamiltonian is

\begin{equation}
\hat{H}_1 = \sum_{pq} \bra{p}h\ket{q} \ql \{ p^{\dagger}q \qr \}  + \sum_{i}\bra{i}h\ket{i}
 \label{def:normal-ordered hamiltonian part 1}
\end{equation}
%
And the two-body 
\begin{align}
\hat{H}_2 &= \frac{1}{4} \sum_{pqrs} \bra{pq}|v|\ket{rs}  \ql \{ p^{\dagger}q^{\dagger}sr \qr \} - \frac{1}{4} \sum_{qri} \bra{iq}|v|\ket{ri}  \ql \{ p^{\dagger} r \qr \}  + \frac{1}{4}  \sum_{qsi} \bra{iq}|v|\ket{is} \ql \{ q^{\dagger}s \qr \} \nonumber \\
%
& + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{pri} \bra{pi}|v|\ket{ri} \ql \{ p^{\dagger} r \qr \} - \frac{1}{4} \sum_{psi} \bra{pi}|v|\ket{is}\ql \{ p^{\dagger} s \qr \} + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{ij}\ql [ \bra{ij}|v|\ket{ij} - \bra{ij}|v|\ket{ji}\qr ] 
 \label{def:normal-ordered hamiltonain part 2}
\end{align}
%
The second term are equal to fourth term. And the third terms is equal to the fifth term.  

\begin{align}
 \hat{H} &= \sum_{pq} \bra{p}h\ket{q} \ql \{ p^{\dagger}q \qr \} + \sum_{i}\bra{i}h\ket{i} + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{pqrs} \bra{pq}|v|\ket{rs} \ql \{ p^{\dagger}q^{\dagger}sr \qr \}   \nonumber \\ 
&+ \frac{1}{2} \sum_{pri} \bra{ip}|v|\ket{ri}\ql \{ p^{\dagger} r \qr  \} - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{psi} \bra{pi}|v|\ket{is}\ql \{ p^{\dagger} s \qr \} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} \bra{ij}|v|\ket{ij}
\label{def:second-ordered Hamiltonian1}
\end{align}
%
We have changed summation variable $s,r\rightarrow q$

\begin{align}
 \hat{H} &= \sum_{pq} \bra{p}h\ket{q} \ql \{ p^{\dagger}q \qr \} + \sum_{i}\bra{i}h\ket{i} + \frac{1}{4} \sum_{pqrs} \bra{pq}|v|\ket{rs} \ql \{ p^{\dagger}q^{\dagger}sr \qr \}   \nonumber \\ 
& + \sum_{pq} \ql (  \bra{p}h\ket{q} + \sum_{i}\bra{ip}|v|\ket{qi}  \qr ) \ql \{ p^{\dagger} q \qr \} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} \bra{ij}|v|\ket{ij}
 \label{def:second-ordered Hamiltonian2}
\end{align}
%
We define the following
\begin{align}
f_q^p         &\equiv  \bra{p}h\ket{q} + \sum_{i}\bra{ip}|v|\ket{qi}  \label{def:f_p^q} \\
\hh{F}_N      &\equiv  \sum_{pq} f_q^p  \ql \{ p^{\dagger} q \qr \}    \label{def:F_N}     \\
\hh{V}_N      &\equiv  \frac{1}{4} \sum_{pqrs} \bra{pq}|v|\ket{rs} \ql \{ p^{\dagger}q^{\dagger}sr \qr \}\label{def:V_N}  \\
\hh{H}_N      &\equiv  \hh{F}_N + \hh{V}_N \label{def:H_N} 
\end{align}
%
From Eq. (\ref{def:second-ordered Hamiltonian2}) we see that only the last term survives and expectation value would be
\begin{equation}
\bra{\bf 0}\hh{H}\ket{\bf 0} = \sum_i \bra{i}h\ket{i} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} \bra{ij}|v|\ket{ij} 
 \label{eq:second-qunatized reference expectation value}
\end{equation}
%
Finally the Hamiltonian reads
\begin{equation}
\hh{H} = \hh{H}_N + \bra{\bf 0}\hh{H}\ket{\bf 0}
 \label{eq:final normal ordered hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
%
And the normal-ordered electronic Hamiltonian 
\begin{equation}
\hh{H}_N = \hh{H} - \bra{\bf 0}\hh{H}\ket{\bf 0}
 \label{eq:normal-ordered hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
%
This is nothing but a shift by a constant for the expectation value. The usefullness of this will be clearer when we introduce the Coupled Cluster Theory.

\section{Implementation of the double dot}
We will in this section outline the numerical methods and alogrithms related to finding the one-electron eigenvalues of double dot potential, see section \ref{section:the double dot potential}. The code can take a general potential in two dimentions, and find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. But for our particular problem, we only diagonalize in $x$-direction, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Then find the overlap coefficients with an harmonic oscillator basis
% 
\begin{equation}
  C_{n_x',n_X m_X} = \sum_{n_x}^N \braket{n_x'}{n_X m_X} \ket{n_X m_X} 
\end{equation}
%
Where $n_X$ and $m_X$ are the radial and angular quantum numbers from a polar basis solution, see Eq. \ref{total eigenstate}. Since there is no barrier in the $y$-direction, the hamiltonian \ref{rerescaled Hamiltonian} is separable and we get 
\begin{equation}
  C_{n_Y' m_Y', n_Y m_Y}  = \delta_{n_Y' m_Y', n_Y m_Y}  \ket{n_X m_X} 
\end{equation}
%
The relations between cartesian quantum numbers $(n_x,n_y)$ and $n,m$ are as follows 
\begin{equation}
 E = n_x + n_y + 1 = 2n + |m| + 1
\end{equation}
%
Then our new basis states can be expressed as linear combination of harmonic oscillator states 
%
\begin{equation}
 \ket{a} = \sum_{\alpha} C_\alpha \ket{\alpha} , \qquad C_\alpha =  C_{n_x',n_X m_X} C_{n_Ym_Y} 
 \label{new spinorbitals}
\end{equation}
%
Our goal is to find the two-particle interaction elements in the new basis
%
\begin{equation}
 \bra{ab}v\ket{cd} = \sum_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta} C_\alpha^*C_\beta^*C_\gamma C_\delta \bra{\alpha\beta}v\ket{\gamma\delta}
 \label{new interactions}
\end{equation}
%
The interaction elements for the parabolic qunatum dot Eq. \ref{Hamiltonian for QD} $\bra{\alpha\beta}v\ket{\gamma\delta}$ can be obtained from Simen Kvaal's Open FCI code for quantum dots \cite{kvaalOpenFCI}. 
%
This is a transformation of the interaction elements from a polar basis to a cartesian basis. And these basis transformations are costly to calculate, we have tried optimalize as much as we could. 

These new interaction elements Eq. \ref{new interactions}, together with the new spinorbital quantum numbers Eq. \ref{new spinorbitals} $\ket{a}$ and single-particle energies $\braket{a}{b}$ are used as an input in our CCSD and Hartree-Fock. 

\subsection{Scaling the Hamiltonian}
One of the potentials we wish to study \cite{doubledot2}

\begin{equation}
V(x,y) = \frac{1}{2} m^* \omega_0^2 [x^2 + y^2 -2L_x|x| + L_x^2]
\end{equation}
%
We want our potential to dimentionless in our calculation. Introducing the scaled variables
\begin{align}
 L_x & = L_c \bar{L}_x \\
   x & = x_c \bar{x}   \\ 
   y & = y_c \bar{y}   \\
   \omega_0 &= \omega_c \bar{\omega}
\end{align}
Setting 
\begin{align}
 L_c & = x_c = y_c = l_0 \\
\end{align}
We get
\begin{equation}
  \bar{V} = \frac{1}{2} m^* \omega_0 l_0^2 \left[\bar{x}^2 + \bar{y}^2 - 2|\bar{x}| + \bar{L}_x \right]
\end{equation}
%
And setting
\begin{equation}
l_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m^* \omega_c \bar{\omega}}}
\end{equation}
%
Which gives
\begin{equation}
  \bar{V}_C  =  \frac{\hbar}{2} \omega_c \bar{\omega} \left[\bar{x}^2 + \bar{y}^2 - 2|\bar{x}| + \bar{L}_x \right]
    \label{Vabs}
\end{equation}
%
Defining $E_h$

\begin{equation}
 E_h = \frac{m^*}{\epsilon^2} \qquad \kappa = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r \hbar}
\end{equation}
%
Scaling the Hamiltonian $\hh{H} = E_h \bar{H}$, where $E_h$ is effective Hartrees.
 
\begin{equation}
  \bar{H} = -\frac{\omega_c \bar{\omega} \hbar \kappa^2}{2m^*} \bar{\nabla}^2 + \frac{\hbar\kappa^2}{2m^*}\omega_c\bar{\omega} \left[\bar{x}^2 + \bar{y}^2 - 2|\bar{x}| + \bar{L}_x \right]
\end{equation}
%
Setting 
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\hbar \kappa^2  \omega_c}{m^*} = 1
\end{equation}
%
We then get the one-body Hamiltonian
%
\begin{equation}
 \bar{H} = -\frac{\bar{\omega}}{2} \nabla + \frac{1}{2} \bar{\omega} \left[ \bar{x}^2 + \bar{y}^2 - 2|\bar{x}| + \bar{L}_x \right]
 \label{doublepotential abs}
\end{equation}
%
The two-body interaction is the same as in Eq. \ref{N-body Hamiltonian scaled}. And the total Hamiltonian for our model becomes
%
\begin{equation}
 \bar{H} = -\frac{\bar{\omega}}{2} \nabla + \frac{1}{2} \bar{\omega} \left[ \bar{x}^2 + \bar{y}^2 - 2|\bar{x}| + \bar{L}_x \right] + \sqrt{\bar{\omega}}\sum_{i<j}^N \frac{1}{\bar{r}_{ij}}
  \label{total hamiltonian double dot}
\end{equation}
%
In the article \cite{doubledot2}, they set $L_x = 50$ nm , then we can choose $L_c = 50$ nm and setting $\bar{L}_x = 1$, $\bar{\omega}=1$.

\end{figure}
%
The code that we is so general that we can change the potential, instead of the absolute value barrier $|\bar{x}|$, we can choose a gaussian curve barrier which is smoother. An example could be 
%
\begin{equation}
\bar{V}_G = \frac{1}{2}\bar{\omega}\left[\bar{x}^2 + \bar{y}^2 +V_0 \exp\left(\frac{\bar{x}^2}{2\sigma}\right)\right]
  \label{Vgauss}

\label{fig:Vgauss2D}
\end{figure}
%


\subsection{Finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues}
%
We diagonalize the one-body Hamiltonian in $x$-direction
\begin{equation}
\hh{H}_X = -\frac{\bar{\omega}}{2}\frac{d}{d\bar{x}^2} + V(\bar{x}) 
  \label{we want to diagonalize}
\end{equation}
%
In order to find the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors we can use the technique of discretization described in section \ref{section:the double dot potential}. We use the algorithm (Listing \ref{list:fillingtridiagonal}) to create the tridiagonal matrix Eq. \ref{tridiagonal}

\begin{lstlisting}[label={list:fillingtridiagonal},caption={Filling the tridiagonal matrix}]
    double e = 0.5 * (-1.0) / (xstep * xstep);
    double f = 1.0 / (xstep * xstep);
    double V = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
        x = xmin + i*xstep;
        //        r[i] = x;
        V = potential(x);

        //Filling the diagonal
        T[i][i] = f + V;

        //Filling the off diagonal;
        T[i][i + 1] = e;
        T[i + 1][i] = e;
    }
    //Filling the Last diagonal element
    x = xmin + (N - 1) * xstep;
    V = potential(x);
    T[N - 1][N - 1] = f + V;
\end{lstlisting}
 %
We use the \texttt{LAPACK} routine for solving a symmetric dense matrix, \texttt{dsyev()}, which basically use the accelerated QR-Algorithm, section \ref{section:The QR-Algorithm}. The eigenvalues $E_{n_x'}$ are then sorted in ascending order,

\begin{equation}
 n_{x}' = 0,1,2...N \qquad E_{0} \geq E_1 \geq E_2 \geq ... \geq E_{n_x' = N}
 \label{eigenvalues found by diag}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
  \psi_{n_x'} = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_{n_x'}(x_{\min}) \\ \psi_{n_x'}(x_1) \\ \vdots \\ \psi_{n_x}(x_N) \end{bmatrix}, \qquad x_j = x_{\min} + j\cdot h, \qquad j \in \{0,1,..,N\}                           
\end{equation}
%

\subsection{Finding the coefficients}
We want to find the overlap coefficients
\begin{equation}
C_{n_x',n} = \braket{\psi_{n_x'}}{n} = \sum_{n}^N \psi_{n_x'}(x_i) \psi_n(x_i) \qquad n = 0,1,2,...N
  \label{overlap}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
x_i = x_{\min} + i \cdot h \qquad h = \frac{x_{\max} - x_{\min}}{N} 
\end{equation}

Where $\psi_n(x)$ are the harmonic oscialltor eigenfuncions in one dimention:
%
\begin{align}
  \psi_n(x) & = \left(\frac{\beta}{\pi}\right)^{1/4} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n n!}} H_n(x)e^{\frac{\beta x^2}{2}}
\end{align}
%
\begin{equation}
 \beta = \frac{m \omega}{\hbar}
\end{equation}
%
$H_n(x)$ are the Hermite polynomials \cite{boas}. Using the recursive relation for the Hermite polynomials 
%
\begin{align}
H_{n+1}(x) = 2xH_n(x) - 2nH_{n-1}(x)
\end{align}
%
We get
\begin{align}
  \psi_{n+1} & = \left(\frac{1}{\pi}\right)^{1/4} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n+1} (n+1)!}} H_{n+1}e^{\frac{1 x^2}{2}} \\
             & = \left(\frac{1}{\pi}\right)^{1/4} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n+1} (n+1)!}} \left( 2xH_n - 2nH_{n-1} \right) \\
             & = x\sqrt{\frac{2}{n+1}}\psi_n - \sqrt{\frac{n}{n+1}}\psi_{n-1} 
\end{align}
%
Or 
%
\begin{align}
  \psi_{n} &= x\sqrt{\frac{2}{n}}\psi_{n-1} - \sqrt{\frac{n-1}{n}}\psi_{n-2} 
\end{align}
%
Where
%
\begin{align}
  \psi_0 & = \left(\frac{1}{\pi}\right)^{1/4} e^{-\frac{ x^2}{2}} \\
  \psi_1 & = \left(\frac{1}{\pi}\right)^{1/4} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 2x e^{-\frac{ x^2}{2}}
\end{align}
%
The algorithm for generating the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions and evalute at $x$, $\beta = 1$
%
\begin{lstlisting}
double wf(int n, double x) {
    double *W = new double[n + 2];
    double a = (1.0 / pow(pi, 0.25));
    double b = (1.0 / sqrt(2));

    W[0] = 1.0 * a; //psi_0(x)

    if (n == 0) {
        return W[0] * exp(-0.5 * x * x);
    } else {
        W[1] = sqrt(2) * x * a; //psi_1(x)
        for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {

            W[i + 1] = (sqrt(2.0 / (i + 1)) * x * W[i] - sqrt(double(i) / (i + 1)) * W[i - 1]);
        }
        return W[n] * exp(-0.5 * x * x);
    }

    delete [] W;
\end{lstlisting}
%
The coefficients are then calculated by the following algorithm
%
\begin{lstlisting}
    for (int nxprime = 0; nxprime < nxprime_max; nxprime++) {
        for (int n = 0; n < nmax; n++) {
            innerprod = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                innerprod += xstep * Evecs[i][nxprime] * H[i][n];
            }
            Coeff[n][nxprime] = innerprod;
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Validation}
%
One way to validate the coefficients is to check if it preserve the probability.
\begin{equation}
  P(n') = \sum_{i}^N C_{i,n'}^*C_{i,n'} \approx 1
\end{equation}
%
Another check is to plot the diagonalized curve against the linear expansion and see if 
\begin{equation}
  \sum_i^N |\psi_{n'}(x_i) - \psi_n(x_i)|^2 < \epsilon
\end{equation}


\subsection{Transformation from polar to cartesian representation}
\label{sec:cartesian basis transform}

Harmonic oscillator wavefunctions in two dimentions for som selected values
%
\begin{align}
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{n_x,n_y}(x,y) & = \psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{n_x}(x)\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{n_y}(y)   
  \label{Harmonic Oscillator Wavefunctions Cartesian}
\end{align}
%
\begin{align}
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{n_x,n_y}(x,y) = H_{n_x}(x)H_{n_y}(y) e^{-x^2} e^{-y^2}  
  \label{Harmonic Oscillator Wavefunctions Cartesian Explicit}
\end{align}
In cartesian representation (not normalized): 
\begin{align*}
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{0,0}(x,y) & =  e^{-x^2}e^{-y^2}   & (\epsilon = 1) \\
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{1,0}(x,y) & =  xe^{-x^2}e^{-y^2} & (\epsilon = 2) \\
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{0,1}(x,y) & =  ye^{-x^2}e^{-y^2} & (\epsilon = 2) \\
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{1,1}(x,y) & =  yxe^{-x^2/2}e^{-y^2} & (\epsilon = 3) \\ 
\end{align*}
%
Where $\epsilon = n_x + n_y + 1$.
%
In polar coordinate representation (not normalize):
\begin{align}
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{n,m}(r,\theta) & = R(r)\phi(\theta)  
  \label{Harmonic Oscillator Wavefunctions Polar}
\end{align}
%
\begin{align}
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{n,m}(r,\theta) & = r^{|m|}e^{-r^2}L_n^{|m|}e^{im\theta}  
  \label{Harmonic Oscillator Wavefunctions Polar Explicit}
\end{align}
\begin{align*}
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{0,0}(r,\theta)   & =  e^{-r^2}   & (\epsilon = 1) \\
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{0,1}(r,\theta)   & =  r e^{-r^2}e^{i\theta} & (\epsilon = 2) \\
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{0,-1}(r,\theta)  & =  r e^{-r^2}e^{-i\theta} & (\epsilon = 2) \\
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{1,0}(r,\theta)   & =  (-r^2+1)e^{-r^2} & (\epsilon = 3) \\ 
\end{align*}
%
Where $\epsilon = 2n + |m| + 1$. We transformation between the representation by the following
\begin{align*}
x & = r \cos(\theta) \\
y & = r \sin(\theta) \\
r^2 & = x^2 + y^2
  \label{def:CartesianPolarMapping}
\end{align*}
%
We have that
%
\begin{equation}
\cos(\theta) = \frac{e^{i\theta} + e^{i\theta}}{2} \qquad \cos(\theta) = \frac{e^{i\theta} - e^{i\theta}}{2i}
  \label{cosinus relation}
\end{equation}
%
We see that (normalized):
\begin{align}
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{0,0}(x,y) & = \psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{0,0}(r,\theta)\\
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{1,0}(x,y) & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{1,1}(r,\theta) +   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{1,-1}(r,\theta)\\
\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{0,1}(x,y) & =  \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{1,-1}(r,\theta) -   \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}\psi^{\text{\tiny HO}}_{1,1}(r,\theta)\\
  \label{we see mapping} 
\end{align}
%
The Transformation matrix $T^{N}$, $N = n_x + n_y$ :

\begin{align}
T^{0}  & = 1 \\
T^{1}  & = \begin{bmatrix*}[r] \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
 \end{bmatrix*} \\
T^{2}  & = \begin{bmatrix*}[r] \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix*} \\
T^{N} & = ...
\end{align}
%
These transformation matrices are obtained from Simen Kvaals PhD-thesis \cite{kvaalphd}
Our transformation from a polar basis to a cartesian one is defined
\begin{equation}
\ket{a} \equiv \ket{n_x'(a), n_y'(a)}^{CAR} = \sum_{n_x(a)} C_{n_x(a), n_x'(a)} \sum_{n_+(a)}^{N_a} i^{-n_y'(a)} T_{n_+(a),n_x(a)}^{N_a}
  \label{DoubleDot}
\end{equation}
%
Where $N_a = n_x(a) + n_y'(a)$. 
%
Then the interaction elements in the cartesian space represented by 
%
\begin{align*}
\bra{ab}v\ket{cd}^{CAR} &= \sum_{n_x(a)}\sum_{n_x(b)}\sum_{n_x(c)}\sum_{n_y(d)} C_{n_x(a), n_x'(a)} C_{n_x(b), n_x'(b)} C_{n_x(c), n_x'(c)} C_{n_x(d), n_x'(d)} \\
&\times \sum_{n_+(a)}^{N_a}\sum_{n_+(b)}^{N_b}\sum_{n_+(c)}^{N_c}\sum_{n_+(d)}^{N_d} T_{n_+(a),n_x(a)}^{N_a} T_{n_+(b),n_x(b)}^{N_b} T_{n_+(c),n_x(c)}^{N_c} T_{n_+(d),n_x(d)}^{N_d} \\
&\times \bra{\underbrace{n_+(a)n_-(a)}_{a}|\underbrace{n_+(b)n_-(b)}_b}v\ket{\underbrace{n_+(c)n_-(c)}_c|\underbrace{n_+(d)n_-(d)}_d}^{POL} \\
&\times i^{n_y'(a)} i^{n_y'(b)} i^{-n_y'(c)} i^{-n_y'(d)}
\label{cartesian interaction element representation}
\end{align*}
%
Where 
\begin{align}
  m = n_+ - n_- \qquad n = \frac{n_+ + n_- - |m|}{2} 
\end{align}
%
Think of it as a ladder, where number of $n_+$, defines how high to the right you move on the ladder, and $n_-$ defines how high to the left.
%
Therefore each of the subshells will be defined by a set of $\{n_+,n_-\}$. 
%

\end{figure}


We can do a simple example using the parabolic harmonic oscillator potential, i.e. $L_x=0$ and $V_0 = 0$. Our system is a harmonic oscillator with 2 shell level, and the basis states are:
\begin{align*}
\ket{0} \rightarrow &n_x'=0, n_y'=0, m_s' = -0.5, &E = 0.99988 \\  
\ket{1} \rightarrow &n_x'=0, n_y'=0, m_s' = 0.5,  &E = 0.99988 \\  
\ket{2} \rightarrow &n_x'=1, n_y'=0, m_s' = -0.5, &E = 1.99943 \\  
\ket{3} \rightarrow &n_x'=1, n_y'=0, m_s' =  0.5, &E = 1.99943 \\  
\ket{4} \rightarrow &n_x'=0, n_y'=1, m_s' = -0.5, &E = 1.99988 \\  
\ket{5} \rightarrow &n_x'=0, n_y'=1, m_s' =  0.5, &E = 1.99988  
\end{align*}
Polar basis:
\begin{align*}
  \ket{0} & = \{n=0, m=0, m_s = -0.5\} \\ 
  \ket{1} & = \{n=0, m=0, m_s = 0.5\} \\
  \ket{2} & = \{n=0, m=-1, m_s = -0.5\} \\
  \ket{3} & = \{n=0, m=-1, m_s = 0.5\} \\
  \ket{4} & = \{n=0, m=+1, m_s = -0.5\} \\
  \ket{5} & = \{n=0, m=+1, m_s = 0.5\}   
\end{align*}
Talmi matrix:
\begin{align}
  T^{(1)} &= 1 \\
  T^{(2)} &= \begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &- \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}                             
\end{align}

Want to find the interaction element $\bra{45}v\ket{45}^{CAR}$:
%
\begin{equation}
  \ket{n_x' n_y'}^{CAR} = \sum_{n_x} C_{n_x',n_x} \sum_{n_+}^{n_x+n_y'} T_{n_+,n_x}^{n_x+n_y'} \ket{n_+,n_-}^{POL}
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
  \ket{4}^{CAR} & = T_{0,0}^{(1)} \ket{(n_+=0,n_-=1)}^{POL} + T_{1,0}^{(1)} \ket{(n_+=1,n_-=0)}^{POL} \\
  \ket{5}^{CAR} & = T_{0,0}^{(1)} \ket{(n_+=0,n_-=1)}^{POL} + T_{1,0}^{(1)} \ket{(n_+=1,n_-=0)}^{POL}  
\end{align}
%
If we translate these states into the Polar basis quantum numbers we get, and remember that $\ket{4}$ is a spin down states, so $\{n_+,n_-\}$ must map to a state which is spin down:
\begin{align}
  \ket{4}^{CAR} & = T_{0,0}^{(1)} \ket{4}^{POL} + T_{1,0}^{(1)} \ket{2}^{POL} \\
  \ket{5}^{CAR} & = T_{0,0}^{(1)} \ket{5}^{POL} + T_{1,0}^{(1)} \ket{3}^{POL}  
\end{align}
%
Then 
\begin{align}
  \ket{45}^{CAR} & = (T_{0,0}^{(1)})^2 \ket{4 5}^{POL} + T_{0,0}^{(1)}T_{1,0}^{(1)} \ket{43}^{POL} + T_{1,0}^{(1)}T_{0,0}^{(1)} \ket{25}^{POL} + (T_{1,0}^{(1)})^2 \ket{23}^{POL}  
\end{align}
%
Then 
\begin{align}
  \bra{45}v\ket{45}^{CAR} & = \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} \bra{45}v\ket{45}^{POL} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} \bra{43}v\ket{25}^{POL}  + \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} \bra{43}v\ket{43}^{POL} \\
  &+ \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} \bra{25}v\ket{25}^{POL} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} \bra{25}v\ket{43}^{POL}+ \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} \bra{23}v\ket{23}^{POL}  
\end{align}

  \bra{45}v\ket{45}^{CAR} & = 0.86165 + \frac{1}{2}0.23499 = 0.97915
\end{align}
%
\begin{align}
  \bra{45}v\ket{45}^{POL} & = 0.86165
\end{align}

\subsection{Tabulating new quantum numbers}
In our cartesian basis, the two-particle interaction still does not change spin. Therefore the total spin is conserved.
 
\begin{equation}
  \bra{M_s}v\ket{M_s'} = \delta_{M_s,M_s'} \qquad M_s = m_{1s} + m_{2s} 
\end{equation}

Every odd number is now a spin up state, and even number are spin down. The energy is thereby degenerate in spin.
%
\begin{equation}
\ket{a} = \left\{ \begin{array}{lcl} a = 2n & \mbox{if} & m_s=-0.5\\ 
 a = 2n+1 & \mbox{if} & m_s = 0.5
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
%
In section \ref{parabolic quantum dot} we discussed the shell structure of the parabolic quantum dot. We have the same situasjon now but with a different kind of subshells. We define a subshell with the set of quantum numbers $\{n_x',n_y'\}$, where each subshell have the energy

\begin{equation}
E_{sub} = E_{n_x'} + E_{n_y'}
  \label{subshell energy}
\end{equation}
%
And $E_{n_x'}$ are the eigenvalues found by diagonalization Eq. \ref{eigenvalues found by diag} and Fig. \ref{fig:Vgauss2D}, Fig. \ref{fig:Vgauss3D}. While $E_{n_y'} = (0.5 + n_y')$ are the one-dimentional solution to the harmonic oscillator potential. Example for the potential \ref{Vgauss}, $V=20,\sigma=1$, with $N=500$.

The first 6 spinorbitals are tabulated as

\begin{align*}
  \ket{0} & = \{n_x'=0, n_y'=0, m_s = \downarrow\} & E =  5.68161 \\ 
  \ket{1} & = \{n_x'=0, n_y'=0, m_s = \uparrow \}  & E =  5.68161 \\
  \ket{2} & = \{n_x'=1, n_y'=0, m_s = \downarrow\} & E = 5.68161 \\
  \ket{3} & = \{n_x'=1, n_y'=0, m_s = \uparrow \}  & E =  5.68161 \\
  \ket{4} & = \{n_x'=1, n_y'=1, m_s = \downarrow\} & E = 6.68162\\
  \ket{5} & = \{n_x'=1, n_y'=1, m_s = \uparrow \}  & E = 6.68162 
\end{align*}



\subsection{Validation of the Code}
One of the test we can do is to drop the barrier in the $x$-direction, i.e. $L_x = 0$ in Eq. \ref{doublepotential abs}. Then we get a harmonic oscillator potential. And we want to do a diagonalization for the 2-shell case. We get 6 single-particle states with eigenvalues in the cartesian basis:

\begin{align*}
\ket{0} \rightarrow &\{n_x'=0, n_y'=0, m_s' = \downarrow\} &E = 0.99988 \\  
\ket{1} \rightarrow &\{n_x'=0, n_y'=0, m_s' = \uparrow \} &E =  0.99988 \\  
\ket{2} \rightarrow &\{n_x'=1, n_y'=0, m_s' = \downarrow\} &E = 1.99943  \\  
\ket{3} \rightarrow &\{n_x'=1, n_y'=0, m_s' =  \uparrow\} &E =  1.99943  \\  
\ket{4} \rightarrow &\{n_x'=0, n_y'=1, m_s' = \downarrow\} &E = 1.99988 \\  
\ket{5} \rightarrow &\{n_x'=0, n_y'=1, m_s' =  \uparrow\} &E =  1.99988  
\end{align*}

If we start with the case $M_s = -1$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{H} = \begin{bmatrix}
\bra{\Phi_{02}}H_0\ket{\Phi_{02}} + \bra{\Phi_{02}}V\ket{\Phi_{02}} & 
\bra{\Phi_{02}}H_0\ket{\Phi_{04}} + \bra{\Phi_{02}}V\ket{\Phi_{04}} &  
\bra{\Phi_{02}}H_0\ket{\Phi_{24}} + \bra{\Phi_{02}}V\ket{\Phi_{24}} \\
\bra{\Phi_{04}}H_0\ket{\Phi_{02}} + \bra{\Phi_{04}}V\ket{\Phi_{02}} & 
\bra{\Phi_{04}}H_0\ket{\Phi_{04}} + \bra{\Phi_{04}}V\ket{\Phi_{04}} &  
\bra{\Phi_{04}}H_0\ket{\Phi_{24}} + \bra{\Phi_{04}}V\ket{\Phi_{24}} \\
\bra{\Phi_{24}}H_0\ket{\Phi_{02}} + \bra{\Phi_{24}}V\ket{\Phi_{02}} & 
\bra{\Phi_{24}}H_0\ket{\Phi_{04}} + \bra{\Phi_{24}}V\ket{\Phi_{04}} &  
\bra{\Phi_{24}}H_0\ket{\Phi_{24}} + \bra{\Phi_{34}}V\ket{\Phi_{24}} \\
\end{bmatrix}
  \label{validationDiagonalizationoftheHarmonicOscillator}
\end{equation*}
%
Where the Slater determinant is defined as
\begin{equation}
\ket{\Phi_{ab}} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ket{ab}-\ket{ba}\right)
  \label{slater}
\end{equation}
%
Then we get
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{H} & \approx \begin{bmatrix}
2 + \bra{02}v\ket{02}_{\text{AS}} & 
    \bra{02}v\ket{04}_{\text{AS}} &  
    \bra{02}v\ket{24}_{\text{AS}} \\
    \bra{04}v\ket{02}_{\text{AS}} & 
4 + \bra{04}v\ket{04}_{\text{AS}} &  
    \bra{04}v\ket{24}_{\text{AS}} \\
    \bra{24}v\ket{02}_{\text{AS}} & 
    \bra{24}v\ket{04}_{\text{AS}} &  
4 + \bra{24}v\ket{24}_{\text{AS}} \\
\end{bmatrix}\\
&= \begin{bmatrix}
    3.6260   &      0    &     0 \\
         0  &  3.6264     &    0 \\
         0   &      0   & 4.6260 \\
\end{bmatrix}\\
  \label{validationDiagonalizationoftheHarmonicOscillator}
\end{align*}
%
Which is what we get when we diagonalize for $M_s=0$ in polar basis. The case $M_s=1$ is excatly the same, and for 
the $Ms = 0$ we get the eigvalues 

\begin{align*}
E_0 &= 3.1523 \qquad E_1 = 3.6260 \qquad E_2 = 3.6264 \\
E_3 &= 4.2533 \qquad E_4 = 4.2533 \qquad E_5 = 4.6267 \\
E_6 &= 4.8617 \qquad E_7 = 4.8617 \qquad E_8 = 5.1976 
\end{align*}
%
Which is the same as for the polar basis.

\caption{Ground-state energies for holes states $nh=2$ in a circular quantum dot using a standard coulomb interaction for $L_x=0$. The interaction elements are obtained from a cartesian basis transformation, section \ref{sec:cartesian basis transform}. HF is the Hartree Fock energy and CCSD is the coupled-cluster energy Eq. \ref{Vabs}. $R_m$ is the total number of subshells while $R_m$ stands for the number of major oscillator shells Fig. \ref{fig:shellnumber}}
\end{table}
%
We define new shell structure, each subshell consist of quantum numbers $n_x'$ and $n_y'$ and they can be occupied with at most 2 electrons. In the special case where we dont have any perturbation in the middle $L_x=0$ or $V_0=0$, some subshells are part of the major oscillator shells which we have discussed in section \ref{parabolic quantum dot}. The relations are

\begin{equation}
R = \frac{R_m(R_m+1)}{2}

The CCSD energy have converged very poorly, I had to reduce the tolerance to 1E-4 for it to converge, and i cased it didnt converge, I've extrapolated the minima.}

% \label{dix:derivation of baker-campbell-hausdorff}
% 
% We will now derive the following relation:
% 
% \begin{align}
% e^{-\lambda \hh{A}}\hh{B}e^{-\lambda\hh{A}} &= \hh{B} + \lambda \ql[\hh{B}, \hh{A}  \qr] + \frac{\lambda^2}{2!} \ql[\ql[\hh{B}, \hh{A}  \qr],\hh{A} \qr] + \frac{\lambda^3}{3!} \ql[ \ql[\ql[\hh{B}, \hh{A}  \qr],\hh{A} \qr],\hh{A} \qr] +...
% \nonumber \\
% &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} (\text{ad}(\hh{B}))^n \hh{A}, \qquad (\text{ad}(\hh{B}))^n \hh{A} = \ql[ \ql[\ql[\hh{B}..., \hh{A}  \qr],\hh{A} \qr],\hh{A} \qr]\,\,\,(\text{n times})
% \label{app:show this relation} 
% \end{align}
% %
% We define 
% 
% \begin{equation}
% \hh{G}(\lambda) = e^{-\lambda \hh{A}}\hh{B}e^{\lambda \hh{A}}
%  \label{app:G(lambda)}
% \end{equation}
% %
% We want to do a Taylor series expansion with this function around $\lambda = 0$,
% 
% \begin{equation}
% \hh{G}(\lambda) = \hh{G}(0) + \ql .\frac{d\hh{G}}{d\lambda} \qr|_{\lambda = 0} (\lambda-0) + \frac{1}{2!} \ql .\frac{d^2\hh{G}}{d^2\lambda} \qr|_{\lambda = 0} (\lambda-0)^2 + \frac{1}{3!} \ql .\frac{d^3\hh{G}}{d^3\lambda} \qr|_{\lambda = 0} (\lambda-0)^3 + ...
%  \label{app:Taylor expansion}
% \end{equation}
% %
% {\bf{0th order}}:
% \begin{equation}
% \hh{G}(0) = \hh{B} 
%  \label{app:0th order}
% \end{equation}
% %
% {\bf{1th order}}:
% \begin{equation}
% \ql.\frac{d\hh{G}}{d\lambda} \qr|_{\lambda = 0} = \ql[ -\hh{A}e^{-\lambda \hh{A}}\hh{B}e^{\lambda \hh{A}} + e^{-\lambda \hh{A}}\hh{B}e^{\lambda \hh{A}}\hh{A} \qr]_{\lambda = 0} = \ql[\hh{G}(0),\hh{A}\qr] = \ql[\hh{B},\hh{A}\qr] 
%  \label{app:1th order}
% \end{equation}
% %
% {\bf{2nd order}}:
% \begin{equation}
% \frac{d^2\hh{G}}{d^2\lambda} = \frac{d\hh{G}}{d\lambda} \ql[\hh{G},\hh{A}\qr] = \ql[ \frac{d\hh{G}}{d\lambda},\hh{A}\qr] =  
% \ql[ \ql[ \hh{G},\hh{A}\qr] ,\hh{A}\qr] \label{app:2th order} 
% \end{equation}
% %
% \begin{equation}
% \Rightarrow \ql.\frac{d^2\hh{G}}{d^2\lambda}\qr|_{\lambda=0} = \ql[ \ql[ \hh{B},\hh{A}\qr] ,\hh{A}\qr] \label{defapp:2th order 2} 
% \end{equation}
% %
% {\bf{3rd order}}:
% \begin{equation}
% \frac{d^3\hh{G}}{d^3\lambda} = \frac{d\hh{G}}{d\lambda} \ql[\ql[\hh{G},\hh{A}\qr],\hh{A}\qr] = \ql[\ql[\frac{d\hh{G}}{d\lambda} ,\hh{A}\qr],\hh{A}\qr] =  
% \ql[ \ql[ \ql[ \hh{G},\hh{A}\qr],\hh{A}\qr] ,\hh{A}\qr] \label{app:3th order} 
% \end{equation}
% %
% \begin{equation}
% \Rightarrow \ql.\frac{d^3\hh{G}}{d^3\lambda}\qr|_{\lambda=0} = \ql[ \ql[\ql[ \hh{B},\hh{A}\qr],\hh{A}\qr] ,\hh{A}\qr] \label{defapp:3th order 2} 
% \end{equation}

% {\bf{n-th order}}:
% \begin{equation}
% \frac{d^n\hh{G}}{d^n\lambda} = \frac{d\hh{G}}{d\lambda} \underbrace{\ql[ \ql[\ql[\hh{G}..., \hh{A}  \qr],\hh{A} \qr],\hh{A} \qr]}_{\text{$(n-1)$ nested commutators}} =  \underbrace{\ql[ \ql[\ql[\hh{G}..., \hh{A}  \qr],\hh{A} \qr],\hh{A} \qr]}_{\text{$n$ nested commutators}} \nonumber
