\kap{NN-scattering up to 1 GeV}\label{chap:NN-scattering up to 1 GeV}


There can be some inelasticity from Bremsstrahlung ($N+N\to N+N+\gamma)$ in the scattering.
This term is small and will diaper when we neglect the electromagnetic force. Larger inelasticity
are entering the picture for lab energies about 300 MeV.
This is due to
fact that at 300 MeV, nucleons have enough energy to create a free $\pi$-meson ($N+N\to N+N+\pi$).
At higher
energies creations of other mesons will also enter the process.
Creation of such mesons will also have an effect on the phase shifts.

At 600 MeV creation of two $\pi$-mesons are possible, but at this energy another important factor to the inelasticity
can arrive.
This is due to the the excitations of one the nucleons into $\triangle$(1232).
%If the state is virtually excited to $\triangle$, the virtual state can fall back to the ground state (N). In this process, 
%there will be created a free meson in the process.
%This has such a big effect on the inelasticity since it doesn't only slow down the speed of the nucleons, which is what the
%$\pi$-mesons does. $\triangle$ excitation also remove one nucleon in the process.
%But the biggest contribution to the
%inelasticity at higher energies is the 2 mesons exchange that can change one of the incoming nucleons. At
%lab energies around 600 MeV we can get the 2 $\pi$ exchange through the process
$N+N\to N+\triangle$. 
Because of isospin addition rules, this process is only possible with a two nucleon state with isospin $I=1$.
%Where $\triangle$ has the same barion number and the total isospin as the nucleon N it replaced.

If the state is virtually excited to $\triangle$, the virtual state can fall back to the ground state (N). In this process,
there will be created a free meson in the process.

There exist four $\triangle$-barions
and they come from the isospin-$\frac{2}{3}$ barion group.
They can be expressed in terms of quarks as $\triangle^-={\textrm{ddd}}(I_3=-3/2)$,\;$\triangle^-=\textrm{udd}(I_3=-1/2)$,
\;$\triangle^-={\textrm{uud}}(I_3=1/2)$ and $\triangle^{++}={\textrm{uuu}}(I_3=3/2)$. Where $I_3$ is related to the particles
electrical charge. This quatety is concerved since the charge is conseved.
%If we assume that the isospin is a good quantum number. i.e. we neglect the decays done by the
%electromagnetic and the week force.
For the barion dublet we have $n$($I_3=-1/2$) and $p$($I_3=1/2$).
%
%We therefor have that $p+p\to p+\triangle^{+}$ is one of the possible $\triangle$ excitations.
%
At energies above 1,2 GeV we can get double $\triangle$ excitations ($N+N\to \triangle+\triangle$).
This process is posible for states with both isospin 0 and 1.
If we want to include the inelasticety caused by one $\triangle$ exitation using a real potential like the "bonn B"-potential
, we have to include the width $im^{{\text imag}}_\triangle$ 
of the $\triangle$-barions in the propagator $G(E)$ in the $\LS$ equation.
This width (self-energy) will be a complex componet
of the energy/mass. 
\begin{equation}
m_\triangle=m^{{\text real}}_\triangle+im^{{\text imag}}_\triangle
\end{equation}
The real part will be the same as before. Instead of doing this, one can also make use of the complex
potentials all ready on the marked. Machleidts "nna13"-potential is for 
example relatively good up to 1 GeV. This potential
include both one and two virtual $\triangle$ excitations. This self-energy model is
equivalent to three body Feynman diagrams were mesons are emitted in the process. The propagator between a 
excited $\triangle$ and a N is implemented in nna13, and is on the form
\begin{equation}
{{\text G(E)}}=\frac{1}{z_0-E_\triangle-E_{{\text N}}}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
{{\text E}}_{{\triangle}} =\frac{k^2}{2m_{{\triangle}}}+m_{{\triangle}} 
\end{equation}
,
\begin{equation}
{{\text E}}_{{\text N}} =\frac{k^2}{2m_{{\text N}}}+m_{{\text N}} 
\end{equation}
and the on-shell energy is
\begin{equation}
z_0=2\bigg(\frac{q^2_0}{2m_{{\text N}}}+m_{{\text N}}\bigg)  
\end{equation}
The propagator in the  $\LS$ equation will be the same as before, since we still the same NN-propagator.
%One can therefor explane the small
%inelasticity at low enegies, by the small self-energies of N.
At higer energies also effects like N* (Roper resonance) has to be included.

The one boson exchange diagrams of the nna13 potential is build up as shown in fig~\ref{figVnna13},
where also the two exchange diagrams of the $\triangle$ exitation are included.
The nna13 potential also include the cdbonn package, so the potential is also 
calculating some of the more important higer order exchange diagrams. This way
the nna13 potential is fitted very good to the experimental data. 

This is based on a field theoretic moddel, where only the lowest $\triangle$/(N$\pi$) exitations are taken into account. This
moddel is rewriting the fictive $\sigma$ meson as a two messon exchange. Where the 2$\pi$ exchange diagrams are 
the most importent effect,
but also the $\pi\rho$ and $\rho\rho$ exchange diagrams are important. 
From this the diagrams of one and two $\triangle$ exitation
are removed from the $\sigma$. The new $\sigma'$ is therefor a little different from the $\sigma$ from the OBE.
These changes are included in the nna13 potential to decribe the effect of the inelastic part of the scattering.

The fig~\ref{figVnna13}
is a three bodey equation. As mentioned before nna13 uses a coubled two-body channel moddel which is almost equvivalent to
the three bodey equations.

The results of the first phase shifts and inelasticeties with the nna13 potential are plotted in \ref{fig:hiEnergy}. 
From these data one can calucalte the cross section. The total cross section($\sigma$) will be dependet on all the partial waves. 
However the cross section calculated from the phase shifts converges. The importance of
the phase shifts and inelasticity as J increases are shown in tab~\ref{tabcrossel} and tab~\ref{tabcrossinel},
where the program "obs.f" has been used.

%\begin{equation}\label{eq:probforelastic}
%N+N\to N+N
%\end{equation}
%This is the elastic proces. All the other processes are inelastic. $|\eta_l|^2$ can therfor be inteprented as the
%probabilety of elastic scattering (\ref{eq:probforelastic}). This defenition of
%inelatsticity does not contain any information about the relation of all the other inelastic processes. Like
%the probabilety of one pion or two pion creation in the scattering.


For higher energy scattering, we also have to include the substructure of the Hadrons. This model has to be based on quarks, 
and the OBE moddel is no longer sufissient to describe the NN-scattering process.
