\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I dedicate this thesis to my loving wife. Without her everlasting
patience, support and belief, this work would never have become what
it is today.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Morten
Hjorth-Jensen, for his invaluable guidance, for always having time to
spare in a seemingly overbooked schedule, and for making the
incomprehensible a joyous delight.

I am indebted to my fellow students whom have given without demanding
in return. I am particularly thankful for the contribution to the
program code by Mateusz R\o stad and to Jon Kristian Nilsen for always
providing computer aid. I would express my thanks to Victoria
Popsueva and Elise Bergli for sharing both their humor and 
their theoretical insights. Also I would like to thank Simen Kvaal for
making quantum mechanics look easy, and Andreas S\ae bj\o rnsen for
our tight collaboration before he went abroad.

I wish to thank my dear friends for their encouragement, for their
entertainment and for their support. I hope the reason they have not
called these last months is that they are being considerate and not
because they have forgotten me.

Finally, I wish to thank my parents for their love and encouragement,
without whom I would never have enjoyed so many opportunities.
