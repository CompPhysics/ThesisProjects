\section{Quantum Many-Body Theory}

For the rest of this thesis, we limit our attention to the
time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation

\begin{equation*} 
  \hat{H} \Psi = E \Psi
\end{equation*}

Futhermore, we limit our attention to Hamiltonians,

\begin{equation}
  \hat{H}(\mathbf{x}) = \hat{T}(\mathbf{x}) + \hat{V}(\mathbf{x})
\end{equation}

where $\hat{V}(\mathbf{x})$ is Coloumb attraction only.
For a few problems the Schr\"odinger equation has exact solutions, but
this is generally {\bf not} the case. Many-body problems usually does
not have an analytically exact solution, and in this section we will
present some approaches for solving the many-body problem.
