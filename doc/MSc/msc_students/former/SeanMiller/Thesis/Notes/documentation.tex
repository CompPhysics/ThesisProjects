	\chapter{Layout}
	
	My master thesis was built upon the work of Audun Skau Hansen, who, in 2015, received a Msc due to his work on the homogeneous electron gas. His paper, titled \emph{"Coupled Cluster Studies of infinite systems"}, reviewed two different computational schemes he developed to study the infinite electron gas, using the coupled-cluster method. The layout of his program will be presented here, in the form it was when I first received it. This paper is purely meant to explain the program used for my studies. We start with the program layout.
	
	\section{Main.cpp}
	The input parameters for the program are:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{i0} : The number of first shell
		\item \texttt{i1} : The number of last shell
		\item \texttt{iNp} : The number of particles present
		\item \texttt{rs} : The Wigner-Seiz radius
		\item \texttt{iterations} : Maximum number of iterations
		\item \texttt{dConvergenceThreshold} : The number of decimals in the answer
		\item \texttt{dRelaxation} : Relaxation of amplitude updates
		\item \texttt{uiStatAlloc} : Maximum size of statically allocated vectors. (use 100000 on smaller calculations
	\end{itemize}
	
	All this is presented on program startup.
	
	\section{Python}
	\subsection{"makeIntMatrix"}
	Currently (as by 01/11/16) the function essentially wants to make a list $V_{pppp}$, where each element is a numpy matrix where the columns and rows are combinations of SP states. This means, for example, that $V_{pppp}[a,b,c,d] = \langle ab||cd\rangle$. The blocks are identified by a unique number, defined by:
	
	\begin{equation}
		k_{unique}(k=k_a+k_b = k_c+k_d) = k_x + k_y\Delta k + k_z\Delta k^2
	\end{equation}
	
	All combinations where $k_{unique}(k_a+k_b) \neq k_{unique}(k_c+k_d)$ give zero, thus is not stored. This is the explicit implementation of the "block"-approach.
